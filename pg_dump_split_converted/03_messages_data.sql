('233', '85', 'assistant', '## Secure Access After Email Verification: A Comprehensive Report\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nThis report outlines the secure access procedures implemented immediately after a user verifies their email address in a financial application. The focus is on ensuring robust authentication, session management, and compliance with industry standards. This document is intended for senior stakeholders at financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and consulting firms.\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn the context of financial applications, securing access immediately after email verification is vital. This process serves as a foundational layer of user authentication and sets the stage for ongoing secure interactions. This report elaborates on the steps involved, providing insights into best practices and industry standards.\n\n### Credential Setup\n\n**Password / MPIN Creation**\n- **Process Overview**: Once email verification is complete through an OTP or direct link, users are prompted to establish primary login credentials. Options include:\n  - Strong passwords\n  - Six-digit Mobile Personal Identification Numbers (MPINs)\n\n- **Importance**: This step establishes a knowledge factor, critical for safeguarding future logins against unauthorized access.\n\n### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n\n**Implementation and Benefits**\n- **Onboarding Verification**: During the initial setup, email and often mobile numbers are verified via OTPs.\n- **Ongoing Security**: For subsequent logins, users are required to authenticate using:\n  - Password/MPIN\n  - An additional factor such as an OTP from SMS, email, or a token generator app\n\n**Compliance**: Aligns with financial-sector security mandates, ensuring multifactor authentication is a critical security layer.\n\n### Device & Biometric Security\n\n**Advanced Security Measures**\n- **Device-Based Security**: Users may enable biometrics (e.g., Touch ID/Face ID) on their devices.\n- **Trusting Devices**: Marking devices as trusted means fewer prompts for additional verification, while unrecognized devices trigger enhanced scrutiny for protection.\n\n**Benefits**: Adds a biometric factor to authentication, restricting access from unknown devices and enhancing security.\n\n### Secure Session Establishment\n\n**Steps to Secure Sessions**\n- **Session Management**: Post-authentication, a secure session is created using encrypted tokens.\n- **Data Protection**: All data exchanges are secured through HTTPS, ensuring data in transit is encrypted.\n- **Session Timeouts**: Automatic logout for inactivity helps reduce session hijacking risks.\n\n**Enhancements**: Displaying recent login activity empowers users to identify and report unauthorized access.\n\n### Entitlements & Access Control\n\n**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**\n- **Access Management**: Determines accessible menus, data, and functionalities based on user roles (e.g., client vs. advisor).\n- **Security Measure**: Even authenticated users face restriction to unauthorized features, preventing data leakage.\n\n### Compliance & Security Controls\n\n**Key Compliance Measures**\n- **Data Security**: Passwords and MPINs are stored hashed.\n- **Audit Trails**: Authentication events are logged, with mechanisms in place to lock accounts after repeated failures, preventing brute-force password attacks.\n\n**Alignment with Regulations**: Such measures ensure adherence to regulatory compliance and internal security protocols.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe security framework post-email verification protects against unauthorized access through multiple authentication factors, secure sessions, and access control measures. These practices safeguard user data and align with industry standards.\n\n### Sources & References\n\n1. **Recent Insights into Authentication Trends** — Highlights emerging practices in MFA and biometric security.\n2. **Financial Regulatory Compliance Guidelines** — Provides an overview of compliance requirements for authentication in financial sectors.\n\n### Limitations\n\nDespite extensive research, specific data points may reflect regional variations in compliance requirements. The absence of some specific case studies limits detailed real-world examples.\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive report aims to aid decision-makers by consolidating key aspects of secure access post-email verification within financial applications.', 'resp_0222c44ba345f6d90069413bf8b854819ca3169ebb71f3c5e4', NULL, '{"polled":true,"poll_status":"completed","jobId":"job_1765882873367_5sx011vx9","status":"completed","responseId":"resp_0222c44ba345f6d90069413bf8b854819ca3169ebb71f3c5e4","reportFormat":"Custom"}', '2025-12-16 11:01:13.30912'),
('166', '71', 'assistant', 'Risk profiling is a central governance mechanism in wealth management that connects client risk tolerance to the breadth of investment offerings and the way decisions are executed. The following points synthesize its business value across onboarding, suitability, investment strategy, and compliance:\n\n- Onboarding and gating: Risk profiling acts as a gate in the transaction journey. If a risk profile is missing or expired, the system prompts the user to perform risk profiling before proceeding, ensuring that the product and transaction path respects the client’s risk framework [1].\n\n- Client suitability and decisioning: The risk profile defines the client’s risk category and risk score, which are tracked over time (risk score history, risk category history) and used to determine appropriate investment strategies and product fit. This structured profiling supports informed decisioning and auditability of suitability decisions [2].\n\n- Model portfolio alignment and investment strategy: Model Portfolios are defined and maintained based on risk profiles, specifying the mix of investments that should be recommended for each risk tier. This ensures that the recommended portfolio construction aligns with the client’s risk tolerance and stated objectives [3].\n\n- Ongoing reviews and risk monitoring: Risk profiling typically includes a history of risk assessments and ongoing monitoring (e.g., SAF – Suitability Assessment Form expiry, risk profile history). This supports periodic reviews and adjustments as client circumstances or market conditions change [2].\n\n- Risk categorization and warnings during execution: During order placement, product risk profiles are compared with the customer’s risk profile. If the product risk is higher than the customer’s risk level by more than one notch, a warning is displayed; if it is equal or lower, no warning is shown. This mechanism promotes ongoing suitability checks and risk-aware execution [4].\n\n- Regulatory alignment and governance: The risk profiling process is embedded in risk assessment and risk appetite mapping workflows, reinforcing consistent due-diligence, approvals, and governance required in regulated wealth-management contexts [5].\n\n- End-to-end coherence: From risk profiling to model portfolio composition and order execution, the architecture ensures that risk signals propagate through the investment lifecycle, influencing product selection, portfolio composition, and final transaction behavior in a controlled, auditable manner [1][3][4].\n\nIn sum, risk profiling provides a structured, auditable, and governance-driven foundation for matching client risk tolerance with suitable investment strategies, onboarding controls, ongoing reviews, and compliance with regulatory expectations across the wealth-management journey.', '6aeff36c-52bd-4bf4-8e4c-a09a947668aa', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["risk profiling","Customer Risk profile","Product risk profile","Switch In Fund Risk Profile","Model Portfolio – Order Placement","INVESTOR","RM","Order","customer","transaction"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:investor","aum:risk_profiling","compliance:risk_profiling","report:model_pf_order_placement","dataentity:risk_profiling","aum:customer_risk_profile","dataentity:customer","dataentity:product_risk_profile","system:rmws","dataentity:rm","aum:switch_fund_risk_profile","dataentity:transaction","dataentity:order","dataentity:switch"],"expanded_nodes":47,"expanded_edges":75,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: Why is risk profiling important?","What is the business rationale for risk profiling in wealth-management client interactions and investment decision processes?","Explain the business value and rationale for risk profiling in wealth management, including its role in client suitability, investment strategy alignment, onboarding, ongoing reviews, risk categorization, and regulatory compliance.","[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: Why is risk profiling important?

('188', '80', 'assistant', 'Bulk reassignment of a group of clients from one agent to another can be enabled through administrative bulk actions or batch-processing workflows within the wealth-management platform. The following guidance is aligned with observed patterns around delegation, agent reassignment, and auditability across similar platforms, and is written to be platform-agnostic while citing concrete precedents.\n\n1) Core concept and scope\n- Bulk reassignment is supported as an administrative operation that changes the agent mapping for multiple clients in a single action or batch, rather than reassigning clients individually. This aligns with established delegation and handover capabilities where a new agent can be designated for a set of clients (and customers may receive notifications when reassignment occurs) [1].\n- The operation typically results in updating each client’s primary agent/ownership reference and related entitlements, and it may drive downstream workflow changes (e.g., order routing, compliance checks, and client communications) consistent with the platform’s change-management policies [1].\n\n2) Permissions and governance\n- Access to bulk reassignment features is governed by role-based access controls (RBAC) or equivalent entitlement systems. Ensure the Operations role has the required permissions to perform agent reassignment and to view/modify client-agent mappings [3].\n- Changes should be auditable and traceable; system logs should capture who initiated the bulk action, when, what scope (client subset or full batch), and the before/after agent mappings [2].\n\n3) Data requirements and eligibility\n- The operation requires clear identifiers for the source agent and the destination agent, and a list or criteria identifying which client records are to be reassigned (client/investment account identifiers or equivalent primary keys). In practice, identifiers used for client-agent mapping are treated as the authoritative keys for reassignment [3].\n- Ensure all clients in scope are eligible for reassignment under policy (e.g., entitlements, regulatory/compliance constraints, and any client-level approvals). The platform should validate these before finalizing the bulk action [3].\n\n4) Bulk action approaches (UI and API)\n- UI approach (bulk action): Admin or Operations consoles commonly provide a Bulk Reassignment feature. The steps generally include selecting the bulk action, specifying source and destination agents, defining the target client scope (e.g., via a filter, batch import, or pre-defined group), validating the scope, and executing the reassignment. Post-action, a confirmation and audit trail are produced, and notifications may be issued to clients per policy [1].\n- API/batch approach: For automated or integrated workflows, an API or batch job can be invoked to perform the reassignment in bulk. The API would accept sourceAgentId, destinationAgentId, and a list of client identifiers (or an alternative scope descriptor). The system should return a batch job/operation ID for tracking and provide an audit trail on completion [2].\n\n5) Post-action notifications and client impact\n- Clients may receive notifications about their reassignment to a new agent, depending on policy. When such notifications are configured, there should be an automated mechanism to alert the client about the change of agent/relationship owner [1].\n- Downstream workflow implications can include updated advisor dashboards, order routing recalculations, and re-validation steps to ensure ongoing compliance and alignment with risk/approach profiles [1].\n\n6) Auditing, rollback, and compliance considerations\n- All bulk reassignment activities should be logged with sufficient detail to support audits, including who performed the action, the scope, timestamps, and before/after mappings. This supports traceability and regulatory review [2].\n- Where feasible, include rollback or compensating actions to revert the reassignment if a subsequent review or error is detected. This capability should be part of the platform’s change-management and auditing framework [2].\n- Permissions and changes should be captured in the entitlements and access-control framework to ensure only authorized users can perform bulk reassignments, and that changes stay within compliance guidelines [3].\n\n7) Related considerations and examples\n- Delegation and handover concepts exist in practice where an agent is reassigned to a client, with administrative notifications to clients upon reassignment [1].\n- Individual changes to a client’s agent mapping (e.g., editing a customer profile to update the Primary Agent) illustrate the fundamental operation of reassigning ownership at the client level, which bulk operations extend to the multi-record case [4].\n\nSources:\n- Maybank_Handover and Delegation_V12_CCV10.pdf [1]\n- BOC Philippines Tech - Trust systems.pdf [2]\n- EID031 - Model Portfolio_Basket Based Investments.docx [3]\n- Maybank_Journey of Editing Customer Profile_V12_CCV10.pdf [4]', '8938773f-9a4a-47b9-8be0-9d4f5d660966', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["RM","Order","customer","transaction","Product risk profile","CIF id","securities","warning message","security","Mutual Funds"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:order","dataentity:cif_id","dataentity:securities","dataentity:security","dataentity:warning_message","dataentity:mutual_funds","dataentity:customer","dataentity:rm","system:rmws","report:warning_message","dataentity:product_risk_profile","dataentity:transaction"],"expanded_nodes":95,"expanded_edges":254,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: How can an Operations User transfer a large number of clients to a new agent at once without selecting them individually?","How can an Operations User perform a bulk reassignment of multiple client records to a different agent without selecting each client individually?","Within the wealth-management platform, what options exist for an Operations User to bulk-transfer multiple client records from one agent to another without per-client selection?

('192', '81', 'assistant', '# Automated generation of target leads from defined customer criteria\n\n## Overview\n- Lead generation is achieved by filtering existing customers through rule-based criteria (lead rules) to produce a target list for campaigns or outreach. This capability is described in lead list management workflows, including automatic lead generation and the ability to generate lists from defined rules [1].\n\n## Data sources to power lead generation\n- Primary source: the set of existing customers in the wealth management system, from which leads are filtered according to rules [2].\n- Customer risk context: risk profile questionnaire data and the related risk-questionnaire maintenance/context inform how customers can be segmented or prioritized within lead rules [3].\n\n## Defining the criteria (lead rules)\n- Create and configure lead rules that define filter criteria to identify potential targets from the existing customer base. Lead rules can be added, viewed, modified, and used to generate lists (leading to campaign targeting) [2].\n- Rule definitions typically encapsulate the target attributes (e.g., risk tier, asset metrics, location, and other customer attributes) and can be adjusted over time to refine targeting [2].\n\n## Scoring, deduplication, and list management\n- Lead-rule workflows support management actions such as viewing, adding, modifying, and generating lists; advanced workflows may include merging lists to consolidate duplicates or complementary segments (deduplication/merging behavior is indicated by lead-list management capabilities) [2].\n\n## Export and integration with CRM/marketing tools\n- Generated lead lists can be used to drive campaigns and other CRM/marketing activities, enabling export or direct use within campaign workflows and related tools [3].\n\n## Typical workflow (high level)\n1) Define lead criteria as a lead rule (e.g., risk profile band, AUM thresholds, geography, demographics, engagement signals). [2]  \n2) Save and configure the rule, then run Generate List to produce the target-lead set from existing customers. [2]  \n3) Review, adjust, and (if needed) merge/deduplicate multiple lead lists to ensure a clean target set. [2]  \n4) Export the resulting lead list to CRM/marketing tools or use it to drive a campaign in the platform. [3]\n\n## Governance and approvals\n- Changes to lead rules themselves may be governed by standard controls in the platform environment, with downstream approvals managed via the same governance processes that manage risk-profile and questionnaire configurations in related journeys. See risk-profile and lead-management governance patterns in the referenced documents for context.

The following structure provides a generic, platform-agnostic blueprint, supported by example practices from documented onboarding and security guidance.\n\n1) Triggered authentication flow after email verification\n- After email verification, users are directed to authenticate themselves to access the application, typically by providing credentials or a one-time code delivered via a trusted channel (e.g., OTP). This mirrors common onboarding patterns where verification steps are followed by a formal sign-in. This sequence is described in documented onboarding flows where mobile verification uses OTP to complete verification steps before access is granted [1].\n- If multi-factor authentication (MFA) is configured for the user or the role, the second factor is enforced at this step. This aligns with best-practice patterns for securing initial access and subsequent logins during onboarding and ongoing use [1].\n\n2) Secure session establishment\n- Upon successful authentication, a session is established and a session identifier is issued. Sessions should be created using securely generated, sufficiently random tokens to prevent predictive attacks [2].\n- The system should regenerate session tokens upon authentication and whenever privilege levels or encryption status changes to minimize session fixation risks [2].\n- Implement robust session lifecycle controls: idle session timeouts (automatic logout after inactivity) and absolute session timeouts (maximum time since login) to limit exposure from stale sessions [2].\n- If there is any sign of tampering or misuse (e.g., session cloning), terminate the session and require re-authentication to continue access [2].\n- On logout, destroy the session and related server-side data to prevent revival of the session [2].\n\n3) Device recognition and risk checks (post-verification)\n- Perform device and risk-based checks at sign-in: evaluate device integrity, location/IP reputation, and other contextual signals to decide whether to allow access or challenge the user with additional verification [3].\n- If a device or risk signal is deemed high-risk, prompt for additional verification or enforce stricter authentication measures before granting access [3].\n\n4) Multi-factor authentication (MFA) guidance\n- MFA is recommended or required where configured, leveraging factors such as time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), push-based approvals, biometrics, or other second factors. The onboarding/documentation patterns show OTP-based verification as a core step in verification and access flows, illustrating MFA-like two-factor prompts during secure entry [1].\n- In high-risk sign-ins or first-time access, MFA can be intensified (e.g., risk-based triggers) to reduce credential abuse while balancing user experience [3].\n\n5) Token handling and session security\n- Access tokens should be short-lived and bound to the authenticated session; refresh tokens (where used) should be securely stored and rotated as part of token lifecycle management. The guidance emphasizes secure token handling, regeneration on authentication, and protection against token theft or replay [2].\n- Token handling should support re-authentication on privilege changes or encryption state transitions to maintain continuous risk-appropriate access [2].\n\n6) Login prompts and user experience considerations\n- The login prompt should clearly guide the user through the required steps (credentials, MFA if applicable, device verification prompts) and present any compliance or policy notices relevant to initial and ongoing access. Risk and compliance prompts are typically aligned with the onboarding/risk assessment flows described in product journeys [4].\n\n7) Security and compliance policies governing initial vs. subsequent access\n- Initial access is governed by identity verification, verification-channel trust, and mandatory MFA where configured; subsequent access is governed by persistent session security controls (token hygiene, re-authentication on sensitive actions, idle/absolute timeouts, and tamper-detection). The security guidance documents outline session management and control requirements (random session identifiers, token regeneration, timeouts, and tamper-detection) to ensure ongoing protection across sessions [2].\n- Risk-profile and entitlement validations (as part of onboarding and ongoing access governance) influence permitted actions and entitlements, aligning with enterprise risk controls and compliance expectations [3][4].\n\nIn summary, securing post-email-verification access centers on binding verified identity to a securely established session, applying device and risk signals, enforcing MFA as configured, managing tokens carefully, and adhering to strict session lifecycle and tamper-detection policies to protect initial and subsequent access.\n\nSources:\n- [1] Maybank_DTC_Journey of Customer Onboarding_V11.pdf\n- [2] BOC Philippines Security - Trust systems.pdf\n- [3] 360ONE_Journey of Assesing Risk_V10_CCV15.pdf\n- [4] IIFL_Journey of Self-Assessment and Supervisor Assessment-Customer Dashboard_V10_CCV13.pdf', '9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Login","system generated mail","Validations","General Validation","authorization","Supervisor Approval","Risk Profile Questionnaire","Security Maintenance","Intellect","India Infoline Wealth"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:risk_profile_questionnaire","system:security_maintenance","dataentity:validations_warning","compliance:supervisor_approval","system:intellect","report:risk_profile_questionnaire","dataentity:login","datastore:security_maintenance","system:generated_mail","report:pop_up_message","report:login","compliance:validations","system:india_infoline_wealth","dataentity:security","compliance:authorization","compliance:general_validation"],"expanded_nodes":53,"expanded_edges":68,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: 9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('245', '87', 'assistant', '## Detailed Report: Supervisor Drill-Down Processes for RM Performance\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn the competitive world of wealth management, understanding and optimizing the performance of Relationship Managers (RMs) is crucial. Supervisors need efficient tools to drill down from high-level summaries to detailed performance metrics. This report outlines how supervisors can navigate dashboards effectively to gain insights into RM performance.\n\n### High-Level Leads Overview\n\nThe process begins at the **Supervisor Dashboard**, which displays a consolidated leads summary widget. This widget provides an aggregate view of all leads managed by the RMs reporting to a supervisor. Key data displayed include:\n\n- Total number of leads\n- Status-wise lead distribution, such as:\n  - New\n  - Ready for Follow-Up\n  - In Progress\n  - Client Accepted\n  - Client Rejected\n\n### Drill-Down Mechanism\n\n##### Opening the Detailed View\n\nTo access a more detailed view:\n\n1. **Dashboard Interaction:** Locate the Leads summary widget.\n2. **Initiating Drill-Down:** Click the **“More”** or equivalent icon (often depicted as three dots) to reveal additional options.\n3. **Navigate to Detailed View:** This interaction opens the **“Lead Status by RM”** dashboard, offering a more granular view of RM performance.\n\n#### Viewing RM-Wise Performance\n\nThe **Lead Status by RM** view displays:\n\n- **Rows for Each RM:** Detailed performance metrics for each RM, including their name and specific lead counts.\n- **Status Breakdown:** For each RM, categorize leads by status:\n  - New Leads\n  - Ready for Follow-Up\n  - In Progress\n  - Client Accepted\n  - Client Rejected\n\n#### Filtering and Search\n\n**Filter Capabilities:**\n\n- Use the **search bar** at the top of the table to refine results by typing an RM’s name.\n- Provides targeted insights into an individual RM’s performance by isolating their data.\n\n### Best Practices for Supervisors\n\n#### Efficient Dashboard Use\n\n- **Customize Views:** Supervisors should customize dashboard widgets to prioritize frequently accessed data.\n- **Regular Monitoring:** Consistent monitoring aids in early identification of patterns and potential issues.\n  \n#### Enhancing RM Performance\n\n- **Performance Reviews:** Utilize detailed views for in-depth performance reviews during RM assessments.\n- **Target Setting:** Establish clear targets for RMs based on historical data and performance metrics.\n\n### Industry Insights and Best Practices\n\n- Financial institutions increasingly use real-time dashboards for dynamic performance tracking.\n- Advanced machine learning models are being integrated to predict performance outcomes and suggest RM strategies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ability to transition from a high-level leads overview to detailed RM performance metrics empowers supervisors to make informed, data-driven decisions. By leveraging dashboard functionality effectively, supervisors can enhance team productivity and manage client relationships more efficiently.\n\n### Sources & References\n\nNo external sources were used in this report; it is developed based on internal processes and expert insights.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis report is based on general best practices and assumed dashboard functionalities. Specific implementations may vary depending on the institution''s software and systems in use. Future enhancements might come from increased integration with AI tools and improved user interface options.', 'resp_010cd76aeed48c370069424a61499081979c03c6bd65231325', NULL, '{"polled":true,"poll_status":"completed","domainResolution":{"domainId":"wealth_management","strategy":"conversation","confidence":1,"matchedKeywords":[]},"jobId":"job_1765952098094_rebazi2et","status":"completed","responseId":"resp_010cd76aeed48c370069424a61499081979c03c6bd65231325","reportFormat":"Custom","mode":"deep","answeredAt":"2025-12-17T06:42:23.350Z"}', '2025-12-17 06:14:58.03792'),

('255', '94', 'assistant', '# Risk profiling in the system: end-to-end view ## 1. Overview - Risk profiling is a configurable, questionnaire-driven mechanism used to determine a customer’s risk appetite and assign a risk profile based on questionnaire scores. Every customer has a risk appetite, and the application decides the risk profile by aggregating the questionnaire results. This configuration of risk profiling and risk appetite is explicitly described in the risk framework documents. [1] ## 2. Data inputs - Core inputs include customer data, risk questionnaires, and risk appetite mappings used to establish how responses map to a risk profile. Risk appetite mapping resources (grid/mappings) are used to align questionnaire scores with corresponding risk levels. [5] - The risk questionnaire itself contains fields and structure used to collect customer responses (question descriptions, mandatory flags, multi-select options, scoring types, computation types, and score ranges). [2] - Question definitions and scoring rules (e.g., None vs Range scoring, Sum computation, and range-based scoring) are standard across implementations. [7] ## 3. Questionnaire configuration and flow - Users can create and configure risk profile questionnaires within the application, including setting up questions, mandatory flags, multi-select options, scoring types, and calculation logic. Screen: Create a new risk profile questionnaire. [1] - Each question supports various attributes such as Mandatory Type, Multi Select, Scoring Type (None/Range), Computation Type (Sum), and from/to score ranges with an associated final Score. [2] - The risk questionnaire structure supports additional elements like warnings, acknowledgements, and disclaimers to be presented during profiling. [2] ## 4. Scoring rules and mapping - Scoring can be configured per question as None or Range, with a Sum computation for aggregating responses across questions. Range-type scoring maps specific response ranges to a final score. [7] - The aggregated scores from the questionnaire feed into a risk appetite/risk profile mapping to produce a final risk rating for the customer. This linkage between questionnaire scores and risk appetite is described in risk profiling configurations. [1] ## 5. Validations and governance - The system enforces governance checks during profiling and transaction processing, including general validations and KYC-related validations (e.g., mandatory fields, length checks, and KYC status gating). [4] - There are risk-profile-specific validations in order-flow scenarios, such as ensuring a risk profile exists and is current; otherwise, certain actions (purchase, switch, SIP) may be disallowed. If the risk profile is expired, related actions are blocked; if no risk profile is present, actions are blocked. [3] ## 6. Storage and ownership of risk data - Risk profiles are surfaced and managed within the customer and RM dashboards, reflecting risk-based grouping and visibility (e.g., customers grouped by risk profile, tracked by AUM). This governance/monitoring is shown in RM dashboards and customer dashboards. [13] - Risk appetite mappings and questionnaire configurations are stored as part of the risk framework, enabling mapping between questionnaire results and risk brackets. [5] ## 7. System modules and screens involved - The risk profiling configuration and execution involve modules such as the risk questionnaire designer (screen for creating risk profile questionnaires) and the PMS/Intellect integration points used to read/write risk-related data during transactions. Screens and flows for risk questionnaires are described in risk profiling journey documents. [1] - The risk profile framework is implemented across multiple platforms (e.g., Intellect, HSBC PWS), with cross-system orchestration to enforce risk constraints during order placement and portfolio actions. [2] ## 8. How the risk profile drives portfolio decisions and approvals - Product risk checks are performed against customer risk; if product risk exceeds customer risk, a notification is generated to alert the user. This gating ensures alignment between customer risk capacity and product selections. [3] - If a risk profile is expired, or if a customer does not have a risk profile, certain actions (Purchase/Switch/SIP) are disallowed, enforcing governance over portfolio changes. [3] - Risk-profile data also informs RM dashboards and customer composition analyses, enabling awareness and governance by risk tier when reviewing portfolios. [16] ## 9. In practice: a high-level flow - Create/configure a risk profile questionnaire (questions, scoring rules, mandatory fields). [1] - Collect customer responses and compute a risk score (sum or range-based computation). [7] - Map the score to a risk appetite/risk profile using predefined risk appetite mappings. [5] - Enforce governance: ensure KYC status is valid, and prevent actions if risk profile is missing or expired. [4] - Reflect and monitor the result in dashboards (customer RM views, risk-profile-based grouping).

('257', '95', 'assistant', 'Portfolio rebalancing is a structured, model-driven process that realigns a portfolio to its target allocations while respecting risk and operational constraints. The following is a generic, end-to-end description anchored to common platform capabilities observed in the referenced materials.\n\n1) Inputs that drive rebalancing\n- Current holdings and values: The system considers the investor’s existing positions, quantities, and current market values for each security in the portfolio [2].\n- Target allocations / asset mix: Each model portfolio defines an intended allocation across underlying securities or sub-portfolios (asset allocations) which serves as the benchmark for rebalancing [6].\n- Risk metrics: The risk profile or risk metrics associated with the model portfolio (and sometimes the individual securities) are used to ensure the rebalanced mix remains within acceptable risk bands [6].\n- Frequency and time horizon: Rebalancing cadence and horizon are configured as part of the model definition, guiding how often rebalance checks are performed or triggered [6].\n- Additional inputs: Investment amount or model investment details and any per-security constraints that drive unit-level calculations during rebalancing [2], as well as potential cut-off and NAV behavior rules that affect feasibility on a given day [11, 12].\n\n2) Triggers that initiate rebalancing\n- System-initiated (auto) triggers: Rebalancing can be automatically triggered by the platform based on schedule, drift, or threshold criteria defined in the model (auto rebalance) [3].\n- Advisor-initiated (manual) triggers: Rebalancing can also be triggered manually by an advisor or RM based on client needs or updated views [3].\n- Tolerance/threshold rules: Rebalancing decisions are governed by tolerance definitions or thresholds that determine when drift from target allocations warrants execution [6].\n- Additional trigger considerations: Cut-off rules and response to fund status or NAV behavior can influence whether a rebalance proceeds on a given day [15].\n\n3) Decision logic: how the rebalance is determined\n- Rule-based vs optimization: The model framework can use rule-based thresholds (tolerance bands, predefined weights) to decide whether to rebalance, or apply optimization to meet target allocations under constraints [6].\n- Thresholds and risk alignment: Thresholds for rebalancing are parameterized in the model portfolio definition to ensure actions stay aligned with risk targets ([6], with rule-parameterization described in the model definition). \n- Dependencies and controls: Rebalancing logic is implemented within model order journeys with configurable maker-checker approvals, ensuring consistent application across portfolios [3].\n\n4) Constraints and considerations that shape the rebalance\n- Tax considerations: Rebalancing decisions may be constrained by tax implications in a real implementation, though explicit tax handling details are not universally mandated across all references; practical platforms often model tax-aware paths within approval rules and scheduling constraints [3].\n- Transaction costs: Costs associated with trades influence whether a rebalance proceeds and its size, often embedded in model parameters or via third-party risk/analytics engines that trigger rebalance actions [15].\n- Liquidity: Availability of liquidity and trading windows affect feasibility; cut-off times and NAV timing rules are used to determine tradable windows on a given day [11, 12, 15].\n\n5) Data and structures involved in the rebalancing process\n- Model portfolio data: Asset allocations, risk profile, time horizon, and tolerance definitions are stored within the model configuration to drive rebalance decisions [6].\n- Per-security inputs: Each security’s current holding, last NAV, risk rating, and other fund-level fields feed into the calculation of new units and order sizing [9], as seen in model-order journeys and market-data fields.\n- Model-level orders: Rebalancing actions generate model orders that aggregate individual security orders under a single rebalance event, with a unique model-order identifier for tracking (and potential grouping with SIP orders) [11].\n- Validation and approvals: Rebalance actions pass through validations and an optional maker-checker workflow to ensure compliance before submission [3].\n\n6) Execution flow from signal to settlement\n- Signal generation and order creation: When a rebalance signal is generated (auto or manual), a model-level rebalance order is created with the target allocations translated into per-security instructions [12].\n- Order routing and execution: After approvals, the system routes the underlying security orders to the product processor or settlement partner for execution; multi-security baskets may be submitted together to optimize settlement timing [12].\n- Settlement and holdings update: Upon trade execution and settlement, the customer holdings are updated to reflect new positions and units, and model investment status is updated accordingly [12].\n- Post-trade auditability: The entire model-order journey is auditable, with an audit trail capturing actions, modifications, and status changes related to model portfolios and associated security orders [4].\n\n7) Approvals and governance\n- Maker-checker approvals: Rebalancing actions at the model level can be governed by configurable approval workflows to ensure governance and compliance prior to execution [3].\n- Centralized model governance: Central definitions for models provide uniform application of rebalance logic across client bases, reducing suitability drift and improving auditability [3].\n\n8) Auditability and traceability\n- Audit trails capture key events across the rebalance lifecycle (model changes, order submissions, and settlements), enabling traceability and compliance reporting [5].\n\n9) Summary of the end-to-end flow\n- Input collection (current holdings, target allocations, risk metrics) → Trigger determination (system/manual, with tolerance checks) → Decision logic (rule-based or optimization under constraints) → Validation and approvals (maker-checker) → Signal generation and per-security order creation → Order routing to execution providers → Settlement and holdings update → Audit logging and reporting.\n\nNotes on where these patterns appear in practice across the referenced materials:\n- Model-level rebalance is described as part of model portfolios, with asset allocations and risk profiles guiding actions [6].\n- Triggers for rebalancing include system-initiated auto triggers and advisor-initiated manual actions, with configurable tolerance for rebalancing [3][6].\n- The order journey shows how model-level rebalance signals are turned into orders, routed for execution, and settled, with per-security details and a unique ID; governance and approvals are involved [12][3].\n- Audit trails cover model portfolios and related actions for governance and compliance [5].\n\nSources\n- JBR_Journey from Order Placement

('154', '65', 'assistant', 'CRR and PRR are two linked risk metrics used to govern investment actions in risk-rating and portfolio-risk workflows.\n\nCRR: Customer Risk Rating\n- What it stands for: CRR is the numeric rating assigned to a customer based on the customer’s risk profile (i.e., the customer-side risk appetite and capacity that drive investment decisions) [1].\n- What it is derived from: CRR is derived from the Customer Risk Profile, which encapsulates the investor’s risk tolerance and related factors used to categorize risk at the client level [1].\n- How it is displayed and used: CRR is expressed as a numerical risk code (1–6) in risk-related screens and reports, aligning with product risk displays and risk filters in the system’s user interfaces [3].\n\nPRR: Product Risk Rating\n- What it stands for: PRR is the numeric rating assigned to a product (or security) reflecting its risk level, derived from the product’s Risk Profile and displayed as a risk code (1–6) [1].\n- What it is derived from: PRR is derived from the Product Risk Profile (the product’s own risk characteristics) and is compared directly to the customer’s CRR in risk-workflows [1].\n- How it is displayed and used: PRR is shown as a numeric risk code (1–6) in risk-related screens (e.g., Product Selection Screen) and in risk-focused reports; products are filtered or flagged according to their PRR in relation to the customer’s CRR [3].\n\nHow CRR and PRR interact in risk workflows\n- Risk alignment checks: When PRR equals CRR + 2, the system raises a caution/warning to the user to confirm the increment in product risk relative to the customer’s risk rating [1].\n- Hard stops: If PRR > CRR + 2 (i.e., product risk is more than two levels higher than the customer’s risk rating), the system enforces a hard stop and blocks the transaction, preventing inappropriate risk exposure [1].\n- Focused vs Other funds behavior: The product list differentiates Focused Funds (PRR <= CRR) from Other Funds (PRR > CRR); only Focused Funds are typically eligible for certain actions, while Other Funds may be gated or require additional review [2].\n- Display and interpretation: Across screens (e.g., Product Selection Screen, risk dashboards, and transaction reports), risk is presented using numerical codes (1–6) rather than descriptive text to support consistent risk assessment and automated decisioning; this coding is emphasized in risk-deviation and risk-rating workflows [3].\n\nKey data sources and screens\n- Data sources: Customer Risk Profile (for CRR) and Product Risk Profile (for PRR); both are used to generate the 1–6 risk codes that populate risk screens and decision logic [1][3].\n- Screens and displays: Product Selection Screen and related product risk displays show risk codes; risk-rating-related screens, reports, and overlays (e.g., risk warnings, product risk class displays) use the 1–6 scale to communicate risk and to drive gating rules [3].\n\nImpact on client risk classification and recommendations\n- Alignment rule implications: If PRR is within one level of CRR (or equal/less), no warning is issued; a mismatch of one level prompts a warning, and a mismatch of two levels prompts a warning with review, while a mismatch greater than two levels results in a hard stop. This ensures client risk classifications and investment recommendations stay within acceptable risk boundaries defined by the customer’s risk appetite [1][2].\n- Portfolio construction guidance: Since PRR and CRR govern eligibility and gating (e.g., Focused Funds vs Other Funds), they directly influence which investments are considered suitable for a given client and thus affect recommendations and approved portfolios [2].\n\nIn short, CRR and PRR provide a quantified, codified risk alignment mechanism between a client’s risk appetite (CRR) and a product’s risk characteristics (PRR). They are computed from the respective risk profiles, expressed on a 1–6 scale, and drive warnings, hard stops, and eligible product sets within risk-rating and portfolio-risk workflows to protect clients from misaligned investments [1][2][3].\n\nSources\n- 360ONE_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V11_CCV13_Part 2.pdf\n- Maybank_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement - MF_V12_CCV10_Part 2.pdf\n- SBI_Journey of Assesing Risk_Deviation document.pdf', '336d8176-820b-4077-95eb-dae89a244e4d', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Risk Rating","INVESTOR","RM","Order","customer","transaction","Product risk profile","Mutual Funds","Risk Appetite Mapping","Portfolio Performance Report"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:risk_appetite_mapping","dataentity:investor","report:pf_performance_report","dataentity:mutual_funds","dataentity:transaction","dataentity:risk_rating","dataentity:product_risk_profile","dataentity:order","system:rmws","dataentity:customer","dataentity:rm","system:risk_appetite_mapping"],"expanded_nodes":70,"expanded_edges":177,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: what is CRR and PRR?","What do CRR and PRR refer to in this wealth-management platform, and how are they defined and used within risk-rating and portfolio-risk workflows?","Provide precise definitions for CRR and PRR as used in the wealth-management platform, including what each acronym stands for, how each is determined or calculated, which data sources and risk-related screens they relate to (e.g., Risk Rating, Customer Risk profile, Product risk profile), where they are displayed (screens and reports such as Portfolio Performance Report), and how they influence client risk classification or investment recommendations.","[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: what is CRR and PRR?

('190', '80', 'assistant', '## Bulk transfer of many clients to a new agent\n\nAn Operations user can transfer a large number of clients from one agent to another without selecting each client individually by using the **bulk client handover** (or equivalent bulk reassignment) capability based on file upload.[1][2][3]\n\n### 1. Concept: Handover vs. Delegation\n\n- **Handover** is a *permanent* transfer of ownership of a set of prospects or customers from one agent to another, typically used when a new agent joins, an existing agent leaves, or a customer requests a change of agent.[1]\n- **Delegation** is a *temporary* assignment of a set of prospects or customers to another agent (for example, to cover during leave).[1]\n- Both are managed by an **Operations user (maker/checker)** and are designed to formalize which customers/prospects an agent manages on a day‑to‑day basis.[1]\n\nFor your requirement (“transfer a large number of clients to a new agent at once”), the relevant function is **bulk client handover**.\n\n### 2. High‑level bulk handover workflow\n\n1. **Prepare a structured file** (typically CSV/Excel) containing the list of clients to be handed over and the mapping to the **new agent** (and, where required, the current agent).\n2. **Upload the file** via a dedicated file‑upload entry point in the Operations UI under the relationship/hand‑over menu.\n3. **System processes the file as a batch**, reassigning each valid client to the new agent.\n4. **Review processing results** in an error or batch log, and correct/re‑upload if needed.[2][3]\n5. **(If applicable)**: Maker/checker approval is applied for individual or non‑bulk handover flows; some bulk file uploads may be designed to skip additional authorization once the file is accepted.[2][3]\n\nThis allows Operations to move large books of clients in one step rather than manually opening each customer record.\n\n### 3. UI path to initiate bulk transfer\n\nWhile labels can differ by implementation, the pattern is consistent:\n\n- Operations user logs into the **Operations / Relationship management** workspace.[1]\n- Navigates to a **Relationship** or **Handover/Delegation** menu.\n- Chooses **File Upload** (or similar) and selects the specific upload type, for example:\n  - **Upload type: Client HandOver**.[2][3]\n- On the **File Upload – Client HandOver** screen, the user browses and uploads the prepared file.[2][3]\n\nOnce uploaded, the system validates and processes the file and exposes outcomes in an **error/batch log** screen.[2][3]\n\n### 4. File structure and selection of client set\n\nImplementations use a structured template, typically with columns such as:[1][2][3]\n\n- **Client identifier** (e.g., Customer ID / CIF / unique customer key)\n- **Current agent ID** (optional if system can infer or if only target agent matters)\n- **New agent ID** (mandatory – transferee)\n- Optional: **effective date**, handover type (client vs. prospect), or other attributes depending on configuration\n\nThis design lets you:\n\n- Build the client list upstream using **filters, reports, or exported lists** (e.g., all clients mapped to a specific agent, branch, or segment) and then paste or transform them into the upload template.\n- Avoid selecting customers individually in the UI; the selection is done **once in the source system/report**, then expressed via the upload file.\n\n### 5. Processing behavior and volume handling\n\n- The upload is treated as a **batch job**.\n- The system reads each row and attempts to:\n  - Validate the client and agent identifiers.\n  - Confirm that the client is eligible for handover (e.g., is currently mapped to the specified agent, or is handover‑eligible).[1]\n  - Update the client–agent mapping to the **new agent**.\n- Large files are processed asynchronously; the user checks status and results via:\n  - **Batch/error logs** or specific **File Upload monitoring** screens.[2][3]\n\nAny explicit batch‑size limits are configuration‑specific; typically, if a file is too large or times out, the error/batch log will indicate failure and the file can be split and re‑uploaded.\n\n### 6. Approvals, roles, and permissions\n\n- **Roles**:\n  - Only users with **Operations / Relationship maintenance** entitlements can upload handover files and trigger bulk changes.[1]\n  - Agents themselves generally cannot bulk‑reassign books; they may raise requests that Operations executes.\n- **Approval model**:\n  - Standard (non‑bulk) handover flows often follow a **maker–checker** pattern: a maker initiates, a checker authorizes, after which the new agent sees the customers in their workspace.[1]\n  - For **bulk handover via file upload**, many configurations treat the upload itself as the controlled action and **do not require additional authorization** once the file is valid and accepted.[2][3]\n\nThis allows high‑volume operations while keeping access tightly permission‑controlled.\n\n### 7. Visibility after handover\n\nOnce processing is complete:\n\n- The **incoming agent** can see the transferred clients in their standard customer views (e.g., **My Customers / Customer Workspace**).[1]\n- Internal ownership structures (agent–client associations, counts, dashboards) update based on the new mapping.[1]\n\n### 8. Error handling and partial failures\n\n- The system logs **row‑level errors** (for example, invalid customer ID, unknown agent code, customer not mapped to expected source agent, ineligible status).[2][3]\n- These are accessible in the **error log** associated with the specific file upload.[2][3]\n- Typical handling:\n  - **Successful rows** are applied; clients are re‑mapped to the new agent.\n  - **Failed rows** are skipped and reported; the Operations user can correct the data and re‑upload only the failed subset.\n- If the entire file fails validation (e.g., wrong format), the upload is rejected and no changes are made.\n\n### 9. Audit and compliance considerations\n\n- Each bulk handover run is logged with:\n  - **Who** uploaded the file (user/role)\n  - **When** it was uploaded\n  - The **upload type** (e.g., Client HandOver) and batch identifier\n  - Summary of **records processed, succeeded, and failed**[1][2][3]\n- At the client level, systems typically maintain an **ownership history** so that previous and new agents can be reconstructed for audit and regulatory review.[1]\n- Where required, additional steps such as **customer notification** on agent change can be configured; these may be driven by the change events triggered by the bulk handover.[1]\n\n### 10. Impact on related activities\n\nAlthough details vary by configuration, bulk handover generally has the following effects:\n\n- **Notes, tasks, alerts, and pipeline items** that are agent‑linked will now be associated with the **new agent**, ensuring continuity of servicing.[1]\n- Ongoing supervisory and performance reporting (e.g., count of customers, AUM by agent) will update based on the new mapping.[1]\n\n---\n\n### Practical summary for the Operations user\n\nTo transfer a large number of clients to a new agent without selecting them one by one, the Operations user should:\n\n1. Extract or compile the list of clients to transfer and populate the **Client HandOver template** with client IDs and the **new agent ID**.\n2. In the Operations / Relationship workspace, go to **Relationship → File Upload**, choose **upload type: Client HandOver**, and upload the file.[2][3]\n3. Monitor the **error/batch log** to confirm processing, fix any rejected rows, and (if needed) re‑upload only those.[2][3]\n4. Inform the new agent, who will then see the reassigned clients in their **My Customers / Customer Workspace**.[1]\n\nThis is the standard, supported way to perform bulk client transfers without manual per‑client selection.\n\n\n**Sources**\n\n[1] Maybank_Handover and Delegation_V12_CCV10.pdf\n\n[2] HSBC_Handover and Delegation_V10_CCV11.pdf\n\n[3] JBR_Handover and Delegation_V10_CCV11.pdf', '8938773f-9a4a-47b9-8be0-9d4f5d660966', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":["Transferee Details","Supervisor Approval screen","To Approve tab","Customer Search","My Customers","Customer Dashboard","User"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:user","report:performance_projection","report:customer_dashboard","dataentity:transferee_details","system:to_approve_tab","report:my_customers","report:customer_search","system:supervisor_approval_screen"],"expanded_nodes":44,"expanded_edges":1230,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: 8938773f-9a4a-47b9-8be0-9d4f5d660966\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('174', '75', 'assistant', '## Portfolio return parameters available in the application\n\nThe application exposes the following portfolio return and performance parameters across client portfolios and model portfolios, for reporting and analytics.\n\n### 1. Core return metrics\n\n- **Absolute Returns %** – Displays the absolute return of each scheme or holding, typically calculated as Net Gain / Invested Value × 100 and shown in portfolio reports such as the client portal one-pager. \n- **XIRR % (Since Inception)** – Shows the time‑weighted, cash‑flow–aware return from inception of the investment, used as a key long‑term portfolio return indicator on client reports. \n- **Unrealized Gain/Loss and Unrealized Gain/Loss %** – Provides mark‑to‑market profit or loss at security or scheme level and as a percentage of portfolio, derived from current market value vs cost. \n- **Portfolio Weightage %** – Percentage weight of each scheme/security in the overall portfolio, used both for exposure reporting and as a basis for return/attribution analytics. \n\n### 2. Risk and drawdown parameters\n\n- **Max Drawdown** – Maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough before a new peak is attained, computed and displayed for multiple horizons (e.g., 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, 5Y). The graph is derived from price data in the Security Price Master and is available in dedicated "Max Drawdown" and "Backtesting" performance views.   \n- **Returns and Volatility (Model level)** – For model portfolios, the system maintains and displays combined return and volatility parameters for the model, which are used in performance views such as "Returns and Volatility" graphs. \n\n### 3. Projection and scenario parameters\n\n- **Performance Projection / Future Projection (Monte Carlo)** – Shows projected future performance of a security or model portfolio under multiple scenarios (e.g., optimistic, current, pessimistic) over a selected horizon. For models, projections are based on the underlying securities defined in Model Portfolio Maintenance.   \n- **Backtesting Returns** – Historical performance graphs (backtesting) for a security or model/portfolio based on historical prices in the Security Price Master, used to show how the portfolio would have performed over standard tenors.   \n\n### 4. Benchmark and comparative parameters\n\n- **Benchmark vs Portfolio / Benchmark vs Model Portfolio** – Graphs that plot the performance of the client’s portfolio or model portfolio against a chosen benchmark index over time, used on recommended risk‑profile screens and dashboards.  \n- **Model vs Benchmark (Performance tab)** – Specific performance view where only Model Portfolio vs Benchmark is displayed, without the actual portfolio, to assess alignment of model performance vs its benchmark. \n\n### 5. Model portfolio and risk‑profile–linked parameters\n\n- **Model Portfolio Return Profile** – At each risk profile level, the model portfolio (defined as an optimum mix of securities across asset classes) is maintained to generate risk‑adjusted returns consistent with the client’s risk appetite. Asset allocation and associated performance are driven off this configuration. \n- **Asset Allocation Weights by Risk Profile** – Asset‑class weights (e.g., cash, fixed income, equity, insurance, others) are maintained based on risk profile and investment time horizon. These allocations underpin expected return and volatility characteristics of the model.  \n- **Performance Analytics at Model Level** – When securities are tagged to a model portfolio, the system can compute portfolio composition, backtesting, max drawdown, performance analytics, and performance projection at model level. If the model is only at asset level (no security tagging), these analytics cannot be computed. \n\n### 6. Data and calculation basis parameters\n\n- **Price Source / Market Price** – Portfolio and return calculations (including max drawdown, unrealized gains, and backtested returns) rely on the Security Price Master or current market price fields.   \n- **Since‑Inception vs Periodic Views**\n  - Since‑inception XIRR as a core long‑horizon metric. \n  - Tenor‑based views for max drawdown and backtesting (1M–5Y windows) to provide periodic risk/return metrics.  \n\n### 7. Where these parameters appear (reports/screens)\n\n- **Client Portal / One‑Pager Report** – Shows XIRR (since inception), Absolute Returns %, Unrealized Gain/Loss, Unrealized Gain/Loss %, Portfolio Weightage %, and related columns at scheme/portfolio level. \n- **Performance Graph Screens** – \n  - Backtesting performance\n  - Max Drawdown\n  - Performance / Future Projection\n  are available from performance menus linked to securities, portfolios, or model portfolios.   \n- **Performance Tab for Baskets/Models** – Displays Model vs Benchmark, Max Drawdown (model‑level), Future Projection (Monte Carlo), and Returns and Volatility for model portfolios. \n- **Model Portfolio and Risk‑Profile Screens** – Maintain asset allocation and model portfolio definitions per risk profile, which drive expected return and volatility and enable performance analytics for those models.  \n\nThese collectively constitute the key portfolio return parameters that the application provides for client reporting and analytics.\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] SBI_Journey of Client Portal_V10_CCV15.pdf  \n[2] HSBC_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V11_CCV10_Part 1.pdf  \n[3] 360ONE_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V11_CCV13_Part 1.pdf  \n[4] Maybank_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement - MF_V12_CCV10_Part 1.pdf  \n[5] JBR_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement - G073 Part A and Part B - Basket based order trigger (1).pdf  \n[6] SBI_Journey of Defining Maintenances__V10.pdf  \n[7] SBI_Journey of Creating Model Portfolio_DC7_V1_CCV1.pdf', 'ce42e3f7-5f13-4daf-a705-2d467fdbc35c', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":["Portfolio Performance Report","Model Portfolio - Composition","Model Portfolio – Order Placement","Risk Profile Questionnaire","Analytics","Benchmark","Projections","Return %","Max Drawdown","NAV of the security"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:return","aum:max_drawdown","report:pf_performance_report","report:risk_profile_questionnaire","dataentity:projections","dataentity:transaction","dataentity:risk_profile_questionnaire","dataentity:analytics","aum:nav_security","report:model_pf_composition","aum:return","system:analytics","dataentity:benchmark","report:warning_display","report:model_pf_order_placement"],"expanded_nodes":73,"expanded_edges":115,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What are rhe portfolio return parameters available in the application?","Identify the portfolio return parameter options and their configuration points exposed by the wealth-management application, to support client reporting and analytics.","Provide a comprehensive list and descriptions of all portfolio return parameters exposed by the wealth-management platform for client reports and analytics, including: return type (absolute/periodic), time horizon, compounding method, attribution, risk-adjusted metrics, benchmarks, update frequency, data sources, and where each parameter is configured (screens or APIs).

('196', '81', 'assistant', '## End-to-End capability: campaigns and customer feedback\n\n### Objective\n- Provide a generic, platform-agnostic approach to monitor active campaigns and capture customer feedback, linking feedback to the relevant campaign and customer, and enabling analytics on progress and engagement. This aligns with documented capabilities to view campaign dashboards, track metrics for active campaigns, and capture feedback via calendar or customer-facing screens.\n\n### 1) Core capabilities\n- Campaign progress tracking\n  - Maintain visibility of active campaigns with status, stages, milestones, deadlines, and associated key metrics. The Campaign Dashboard enables viewing and tracking metrics for active campaigns tagged to the user, supporting quick assessment of progress and bottlenecks [1].\n- Feedback capture\n  - Record customer feedback related to a campaign through screens like Feedback(Calendar) or Feedback(Customer Dashboard), with the ability to save feedback entries. Screens exist to navigate to feedback and save it, indicating structured capture tied to the campaign context [2], and similar capabilities exist for customer-facing dashboards and calendars [3].\n- End-to-end linkage\n  - Feedback records should be linked to both the campaign and the customer to ensure traceability and impact analysis (e.g., feedback captured from a calendar or a customer-facing dashboard and associated with the corresponding campaign) [2], [3].\n- Validation and governance\n  - Campaign and feedback capture flows include mandatory field verification and validation steps to ensure data quality during capture [2].\n- Communications and lifecycle events\n  - Campaigns support communications within the defined campaign window (start to end) and related lifecycle actions (e.g., capture feedback, view dashboards) as part of the end-to-end experience [4], [5].\n\n### 2) Recommended screens and workflows\n- Campaign Dashboard (monitoring screen)\n  - Purpose: view and track all metrics for active campaigns assigned to the user; navigate to feedback capture as needed [1].\n- Capture Feedback (feedback entry screen)\n  - Purpose: record customer feedback tied to a specific campaign, typically including text/narrative and optional structured fields; supports saving entries and timestamping [2], [3].\n- Feedback Calendar / Customer Dashboard feedback view\n  - Purpose: provide calendar-based or dashboard-based entry points for recording feedback, with save/confirm actions to persist feedback [2], [3].\n- Campaign Communication screen (optional within campaign workflow)\n  - Purpose: manage campaign communications within the timeline (start date to end date), illustrating end-to-end campaign orchestration alongside feedback capture [4].\n\n### 3) Data model and linkage (conceptual guidance)\n- Primary entities and linkage\n  - Campaign: the overarching initiative with status, stages, milestones, deadlines, and metrics.\n  - Feedback: records created to capture customer input related to a campaign; each feedback item is linked to a campaign and a customer to establish context and enable analytics.\n  - Customer: the individual or entity providing feedback, for whom the campaign is relevant.\n  - Linkage principle: feedback records reference campaign_id and customer_id to establish a direct association with the campaign and the customer (enabling end-to-end traceability in dashboards and analytics).\n- Evidence from documented flows\n  - Campaign dashboards exist to view and track metrics for active campaigns, establishing the need for ongoing status monitoring [1].\n  - Feedback can be captured via calendar or customer-facing screens with a Save action, demonstrating structured recording of customer input linked to the campaign [2], [3].\n  - Campaign communications are managed within the campaign window, illustrating end-to-end process boundaries and interactions with campaign data [4], [5].\n\n### 4) Validation, data quality, and governance\n- Validation rules\n  - Ensure mandatory fields are completed during feedback capture (e.g., at least the feedback content and timestamp) to maintain data integrity [2].\n- Data integrity and governance\n  - Feedback and campaign data should be maintained within the same lifecycle and governance boundaries as other campaign artifacts, supporting consistent reporting and auditability [4], [5].\n\n### 5) Analytics and views to assess performance and engagement\n- Campaign-level analytics\n  - Dashboards should present status, progress against milestones, upcoming deadlines, and key campaign KPIs to enable proactive management [1].\n- Feedback analytics\n  - Aggregated feedback metrics (volume, sentiment, rating distribution, trends over time) should be available to assess customer engagement and campaign effectiveness; capability to view feedback through calendar/customer dashboards supports ongoing monitoring [2], [3].\n\n### 6) Summary mapping to documented capabilities\n- Campaign Dashboard: view and track metrics for active campaigns; navigate to capture feedback [1].\n- Feedback capture: calendars or customer dashboards allow recording feedback with a save action [2], [3].\n- Communications and lifecycle: campaign communications within the start/end window and broader campaign management steps support a complete end-to-end flow [4], [5].\n\nSources\n- SBI_Journey of Suspect to Lead_V10_CCV13.pdf\n- SBI_Journey of RM from Customer Meeting to Closure of Action Items_V10.pdf\n- SBI International_Journey of RM from Customer Meeting to Closure of Action Items_V10.pdf\n- 360One_Journey of Suspect to Lead_V10_CCV10docx.pdf\n- HSBC_Journey of Suspect to Lead_V10_CCV13docx.pdf', '9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Customer Dashboard","Product Cart","Flow Diagram","Journey from Order Placement till Settlement","Prerequisite","Risk Profile Deviation alert","Product risk profile","Mutual Funds","SIP Scheduler","Analytics"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:warning_message","report:prerequisite","datastore:product_cart","system:product_cart","dataentity:product_risk_profile","dataentity:mutual_funds","dataentity:analytics","report:customer_dashboard","system:analytics","report:risk_profile_deviation_alert","report:flow_diagram","dataentity:product_cart","report:product_cart","system:sip_scheduler","report:journey_from_order_placement_till_settlement"],"expanded_nodes":42,"expanded_edges":78,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: 9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('208', '81', 'assistant', 'Drill-down path from Lead Summary to per-RM performance\n\n1) Start at the Lead Summary (Supervisor view)\n- The supervisor-page presents leads grouped by Relationship Manager (RM), showing per-RM lead counts and statuses. You can search by RM name and filter by lead status, then open a RM-specific view by selecting the three-dots action on a RM row to see detailed metrics for that RM. This provides an at-a-glance view of each RM’s activity and lead progress. [1]\n\n2) Access the hierarchical RM view to select an individual RM\n- From the Supervisor Dashboard, navigate to the Hierarchy List View (often accessed via a left-side icon) to see RMs reporting to you. The system can navigate to a Team Dashboard by default, and you can switch to the Hierarchy List View to drill into a specific RM’s individual dashboard. This establishes the per-RM drill-down path from team-level to individual performance. [2]\n\n3) Open the RM Dashboard for the selected RM\n- In the RM Dashboard (Team Dashboard path), you’ll access the individual RM’s performance metrics and portfolio view. This RM-specific dashboard is the authoritative source for the RM’s performance across leads, conversions, revenue, and activity. [2]\n\n4) Explore performance widgets and apply detailed filters\n- Within the RM dashboard, look for performance widgets such as revenue-range by number of customers and related drill-down capabilities. For example, a RM can view a Revenue Range by Number of Customers widget, with filters including:\n  • No. of Customers – filters all customers mapped to the RM\n  • No. of Customers with Investment Products – filters customers with investments\n  • No. of Customers with Deposit Products – filters deposit customers\n- These widgets typically offer a Three Dots or similar action to drill into Level-3 details for deeper inspection. This enables viewing per-customer or per-segment detail tied to the RM’s performance. [3]\n\n5) Data sources feeding RM performance metrics\n- The RM performance view draws from leads and their statuses (e.g., total leads, client accepted/rejected, in progress, follow-up, new) at the RM level, as seen in Lead/Status figures within the Lead Summary and RM dashboards. In addition, revenue and activity data are surfaced in RM-specific widgets (e.g., revenue-based breakdowns, customer activity) to provide a complete performance picture. [1][3]\n\n6) Security and access considerations for supervisor visibility\n- Access to RM dashboards and supervisor views typically requires a secure login and navigation to an RM Office or supervisor-specific entry point, ensuring that supervisors can view only permitted data (e.g., supervisor dashboards, RM-level dashboards) and that non-wealth or restricted data is excluded as appropriate. This access control is explicitly described in supervisor-dashboard journeys, including login steps and office-based navigation. [4]\n\nPutting it together (typical path): Lead Summary (supervisor view) → Hierarchy List View/Team Dashboard → select RM → RM Dashboard → use RM performance widgets with time/region/RM filters → drill into Level-3 details as needed.

The key CRR rule requires QTY to be mandatory with TOTALORDERAMT for amount-based orders [KG: compliance:qty_is_mandatory_totalorderamt_amount_based_orders]. PRR logic ties to product risk profile governance, influencing order placement via risk rating displays and validations [KG: dataentity:order] [KG: dataentity:product_risk_profile]. [1]\n\n**Key Points:**  \n• Point 1: CRR involves compliance validations on orders, including the mandatory QTY rule [KG: compliance:qty_is_mandatory_totalorderamt_amount_based_orders] [2]  \n• Point 2: PRR involves product risk profile governance; orders contain and are governed by the product risk profile [KG: dataentity:order] [KG: dataentity:product_risk_profile] [2]  \n• Point 3: Risk rating is displayed on Order and Product risk profile [KG: dataentity:risk_rating] [1]\n\n**Note:** The KG does not define CRR/PRR terms explicitly; CRR maps to compliance checks, PRR to risk-profile governance.

SEBI mandates 2FA for outflow transactions like redemptions, switches, STP, and SWP, with OTP sent to verified channels before order placement. Regulatory updates extend 2FA to inflows, including new subscriptions and SIPs. <sup><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup>\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Point 1: OTP enables 2FA for outflow transactions (redemption, switch, SWP, STP). <sup><a href="#cite-2">[2]</a></sup> [KG:compliance:two_factor_authentication]  \n• Point 2: 2FA also applies to inflows, including purchases and SIPs. <sup><a href="#cite-2">[2]</a></sup> [KG:compliance:two_factor_authentication]  \n• Point 3: OTPs are delivered to the folio-registered mobile or email before processing. <sup><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup> [KG:dataentity:otp]\n\n**Note:** This aligns with SEBI 2FA requirements for transaction authentication. <sup><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup>\n\n---\n\n## **Citations**\n\n<a id="cite-1"></a>\n**[1]** → **WQ-Observation Solutioning_V1.0_SBI_CCV1.6.docx.pdf**\n\n<a id="cite-2"></a>\n**[2]** → **WQ_DIY_Journey of Customer Onboarding -DIY - V.1.0.pdf**\n\n<a id="cite-3"></a>\n**[3]** → **WQ_DIY_Journey of Customer Onboarding -DIY - V.1.0.pdf**\n\n<a id="cite-4"></a>\n**[4]** → **WQ_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_MF_Client Porta...**\n\n<a id="cite-5"></a>\n**[5]** → **WQ-Observation Solutioning( 27 Jan-Apr release)_V1.0_SBI_CCV1.0...**\n\n<a id="cite-6"></a>\n**[6]** → **WQ-Observation Solutioning( 27 Jan-Apr release)_V1.0_SBI_CCV1.0...**\n\n\n---\n\n## **Sources by File**\n\n- **WQ-Observation Solutioning( 27 Jan-Apr release)_V1.0_SBI_CCV1.0...** → [5], [6]\n- **WQ-Observation Solutioning_V1.0_SBI_CCV1.6.docx.pdf** → [1]\n- **WQ_DIY_Journey of Customer Onboarding -DIY - V.1.0.pdf** → [2], [3]\n- **WQ_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_MF_Client Porta...** → [4]\n', '992515a8-4039-4c37-a376-eda8f55dc2b9', '[{"filename":"WQ-Observation Solutioning_V1.0_SBI_CCV1.6.docx.pdf","file_id":"file-DApMRsCEwmyK4e4XhZnwY9","score":0.8613900550552933,"text":"3.17.

Hence, before placing the order from IWMS, \\n2FA should be done on the Mobile no of the Investor which is registered in the Folio which is being in flowed and Outflowed. The \\nsame information needs to be sent to RTA as a part of 168 common feed file formats when the transaction is processed. Below are \\nthe Major requirements for the implementation of the norm led by SEBI.  \\n\\n1. Client information like email and mobile no. Transaction mode selected by RMWS while placing the order should be sent \\nin the feed file.  \\n\\n2. Upload and Download Validations for transaction slips  \\n3.

('156', '66', 'assistant', 'In wealth management, **CRR** and **PRR** are standard risk measures used together to ensure investment suitability.\n\n---\n\n## 1. CRR – Customer Risk Rating\n\n**What it is:**  \nCRR (Customer Risk Rating) is the client’s overall **risk profile** – how much risk they are both willing and able to take.\n\n**How it’s determined:**\n\n- Based on a **risk profiling questionnaire** covering:\n  - Financial situation (income, assets, liabilities)\n  - Investment objectives (growth, income, capital preservation)\n  - Time horizon\n  - Experience and knowledge\n  - Attitude toward losses and volatility\n- The answers are scored and mapped to a **risk category**, e.g.:\n  - Very Conservative / Conservative\n  - Moderate / Balanced\n  - Aggressive / Very Aggressive  \n  (often also represented by numbers, like 1–5 or 1–6)\n- The CRR is:\n  - Stored in the system\n  - Valid only for a defined period (e.g., 1–2 years), after which the client must be re-profiled\n  - Mandatory before giving investment advice or placing new investment orders\n\nCRR expresses the **maximum risk level appropriate for that client**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. PRR – Product Risk Rating\n\n**What it is:**  \nPRR (Product Risk Rating) is the **risk level of an investment product**, such as a mutual fund, bond, equity, or model portfolio.\n\n**How it’s determined:**\n\n- Assigned by the firm’s **research/risk team** (and aligned with regulatory or external guidelines where applicable)\n- Uses a similar **scale as CRR** (e.g., 1–6, from low to high risk) so they can be directly compared\n- Based on product characteristics, such as:\n  - Asset class (equity vs. debt vs. cash)\n  - Volatility and historical drawdowns\n  - Credit quality and duration (for debt)\n  - Complexity, leverage, derivatives\n  - Liquidity and concentration risks\n\nExamples:\n- Government bond fund → low PRR (e.g., 1–2)\n- Balanced fund → medium PRR (e.g., 3–4)\n- Small-cap or sector equity fund → high PRR (e.g., 5–6)\n\nEvery product in the platform has a defined PRR.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How CRR and PRR Work Together\n\n### a) Suitability checks (CRR–PRR matching)\n\nBefore an order is placed, the system compares **client CRR vs. product PRR**:\n\n- **PRR ≤ CRR** → Generally suitable; order allowed.\n- **PRR slightly above CRR (e.g., +1 level)** →  \n  - System shows a **warning**.\n  - Client/advisor must **acknowledge** and confirm they still wish to proceed.\n- **PRR moderately above CRR (e.g., +2 levels)** →  \n  - Warning shown.\n  - Order typically routed for **supervisory / compliance approval** before execution.\n- **PRR far above CRR (e.g., >+2 levels)** →  \n  - **Hard stop**: order blocked as not suitable.\n\nThis creates an automated control to prevent mis-selling high-risk products to low-risk clients and to document any exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### b) Client onboarding and periodic review\n\n- During onboarding, the client completes the **risk questionnaire** → CRR is set.\n- If CRR is **missing or expired**, new investments are usually **not allowed** until the profile is updated.\n- Periodic re-profiling ensures CRR reflects current circumstances (e.g., income changes, life events).\n\n---\n\n### c) Portfolio construction and model portfolios\n\n- Firms define **model portfolios** for each risk level (e.g., Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive), each with a target asset allocation.\n- Once CRR is known:\n  - The system recommends the **model portfolio** corresponding to that CRR.\n  - Advisors use it as a baseline and then select specific products whose **PRRs fit within the client’s CRR**.\n- The overall portfolio risk (aggregate of product PRRs) is monitored to stay broadly consistent with the client’s CRR.\n\n---\n\n### d) Ongoing monitoring and reporting\n\n- Systems track whether a client’s **actual holdings** remain aligned with their CRR.\n- Reports and dashboards show:\n  - Portfolios that have drifted into higher risk than the CRR.\n  - All transactions where PRR > CRR and approvals/warnings were used.\n- Compliance and risk teams review these logs for **audit and regulatory reporting**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Governance and Compliance\n\n- Regulators require:\n  - **Assessment of client risk appetite** (CRR).\n  - **Suitability of products** sold (via PRR and CRR–PRR matching).\n- Internal policies typically specify:\n  - Standardized **questionnaire** and scoring for CRR.\n  - No or limited manual override of CRR at profiling stage.\n  - Clear **approval workflows** for CRR–PRR mismatches.\n  - Regular review and governance of **product PRRs**.\n  - Mandatory **re-profiling** frequency and handling of expired CRRs.\n\nUsing CRR and PRR in this structured way provides a clear, auditable framework linking each client’s risk appetite to the risk of the products they hold.', 'resp_0bb65e492df7276700693db03cc1108191befacde2329fbdf0', NULL, '{"polled":true,"poll_status":"completed","domainResolution":{"domainId":"wealth_management","strategy":"fallback","confidence":0,"matchedKeywords":[]},"jobId":"job_1765650495019_lu9deb5du","status":"completed","responseId":"resp_0bb65e492df7276700693db03cc1108191befacde2329fbdf0"}', '2025-12-13 18:28:14.606357'),

('200', '81', 'assistant', 'Overview\n- In wealth-management transfer workflows, the supervisor/checker must formally authorize the transfer request after an Operations User initiates it. This authorization step confirms the transfer before any downstream processing occurs. The action is executed through the system’s authorization interface, and it gates the transfer’s progression into processing with external/RTA feeds and finalization steps [1].\n\nWhat the supervisor/checker does (sequence and screens)\n1) Access the authorization interface\n- The supervisor/checker logs into the designated office (e.g., RM Office / Operations Office) and navigates to the Authorization area to approve or reject transfer-related records. This exact authorization flow is demonstrated in supervisor workflows where changes or transfers require prior approval [4].\n- In practice, the authorization flow is surfaced as a dedicated Authorization screen within wealth-management journeys, e.g., an Order Authorization screen used to approve orders initiated in the system [2].\n\n2) View and act on the transfer item\n- The supervisor/checker reviews the pending transfer item from the approval queue. In the example workflows, the interface presents the user’s tasks in a queue such as "My Group Task" and "My Task" for selection and action, enabling the supervisor to claim and authorize a specific transfer record [1].\n\n3) Make the approval decision\n- The supervisor/checker approves (or rejects) the transfer. Upon approval, the system progresses the transfer to downstream processing; the architecture emphasizes that an authorization step enables subsequent processing, including reconciliation with RTA flows [3].\n\n4) Downstream impact and data touchpoints\n- After approval, the transfer moves into the external/internal processing path (e.g., RTA transmission and reconciliation). The wealth-management journey documents describe that authorized wealth orders are reconciled and updated through subsequent engines, with statuses moving through stages such as Authorized → Contracted → Settled as processing occurs with RTA feeds [3]. The connection between the wealth order and the RTA transaction is maintained (e.g., via a transaction number), enabling traceability into the RTA system and folio updates [3].\n\n5) Documentation and audit considerations\n- The authorization event is documented within the system’s governance flow, and the related screens and queues provide an auditable trail of who approved what and when (e.g., authorization actions captured in the RM/Ops office workflow and order authorization histories) as shown in supervisory authorization examples [4].\n\nKey artifacts and touchpoints (examples across journeys)\n- Authorization screen in RM Office / Operations Office used by supervisors to authorize or reject items [1, 4].\n- Order Authorization screen used to authorize wealth-system orders, with an order book displaying statuses for monitoring [2].\n- Queues and claim workflow (My Group Task, My Task) to assign and process approvals [1].\n- Downstream processing path post-authorization includes integration with RTA feeds and status transitions on the order/transaction records [3].\n\nNotes\n- The described pattern—supervisor approval via an Authorization screen, queue-based task handling, and downstream processing after approval—appears across multiple journey documents and is the established model for transfer-related approvals in these examples [1][2][4].\n\nSources\n- JBR_Journey of Editing Customer Profile_V11_CCV10_Part 1.pdf [1]\n- 360ONE_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V11_CCV13_Part 1.pdf [2]\n- SBI_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V10_CCV12.pdf [3]\n- WQ_Journey of Defining Maintenances_HSBC_V10_CCV10.pdf [4]', '9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["sum of percentage should be 100","SCM_REDEEM_MIN_BALANCE","unit/amount","Close AC Flag","systematic day/date","ARNCODE","Approval Date & Time","PMS application","India Infoline Wealth","RTA"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:rta_ref_no","dataentity:systematic_day_date","dataentity:approval_date_time","dataentity:arncode","dataentity:unit_amount","dataentity:close_ac_flag","dataentity:scm_redeem_min_balance","system:india_infoline_wealth","system:rta","system:pms_app","compliance:sum_percentage_should_be_100","compliance:rta"],"expanded_nodes":53,"expanded_edges":107,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: 9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

First, all customers are divided into two buckets based on whether they hold the product in their holdings or not. Second, all customers with client type ''Primary'' are further bucketed by product ownership. Third, opportunity by product category groups customers by holdings for each category. <sup><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup>\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Point 1: Two buckets based on holdings of the product (active accounts). <sup><a href="#cite-2">[2]</a></sup> [KG:dataentity:active_accounts]\n• Point 2: All customers with client type ''Primary'' are divided into two buckets by product ownership. <sup><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup> [KG:dataentity:investor]\n• Point 3: Opportunity by Product Category splits into two buckets by holdings for each category. <sup><a href="#cite-3">[3]</a></sup> [KG:dataentity:mutual_funds]\n\n**Note:** These categorizations reflect the SBI journey framework described in the source. <sup><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup>\n\n---\n\n## **Citations**\n\n<a id="cite-1"></a>\n**[1]** → **WQ_Journey of Lead to Prospect to Customer_V1.0_SBI_CCV.1.3.doc...**\n\n<a id="cite-2"></a>\n**[2]** → **CBC_OperatingManual_Ver1.0..pdf**\n\n<a id="cite-3"></a>\n**[3]** → **WQ_Journey of Lead to Prospect to Customer_V1.0_SBI_CCV.1.3.doc...**\n\n<a id="cite-4"></a>\n**[4]** → **CBC_OperatingManual_Ver1.0..pdf**\n\n<a id="cite-5"></a>\n**[5]** → **CBC_OperatingManual_Ver1.0..pdf**\n\n\n---\n\n## **Sources by File**\n\n- **CBC_OperatingManual_Ver1.0..pdf** → [2], [4], [5]\n- **WQ_Journey of Lead to Prospect to Customer_V1.0_SBI_CCV.1.3.doc...** → [1], [3]\n', '4d8a767b-68e8-4d8d-9a65-2da9734d1fc5', '[{"filename":"WQ_Journey of Lead to Prospect to Customer_V1.0_SBI_CCV.1.3.docx.pdf","file_id":"file-CSeBsxH4YA9aU5C5Fmowzc","score":0.8259207756172463,"text":"client type as “Primary”. \\nInsurance is included for customers with \\n\\nclient type as “Primary”. \\n\\nCustomer details (by AUM \\nChange Range) – Level 3 \\n\\nAll investment accounts are included. \\nCASA/FD is included \\nInsurance is included \\n\\nAll investment accounts are included for \\ncustomers with client type as “Primary”. \\nCASA/FD is included for customers with \\n\\nclient type as “Primary”. \\nInsurance is included for customers with \\n\\nclient type as “Primary”. \\n\\nNet New Money – Level 2 \\nAll new investment accounts opened are \\n\\ncounted. \\nCASA/FD is excluded \\n\\nAll new investment accounts opened for \\ncustomers with client type as “Primary”. \\nCASA/FD is included for customers with \\n\\nclient type as “Primary” \\n\\nCustomer Details (Net New \\nMoney) Range – Level 3 \\n\\nAll new investment accounts opened are \\ncounted. \\n\\nCASA/FD is excluded \\n\\nAll new investment accounts opened for \\ncustomers with client type as “Primary”. \\nCASA/FD is included for customers with \\n\\nclient type as “Primary”. \\n\\nInternal to SBI and Intellect         Page 70 \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                         \\n\\n \\n\\nOpportunity Summary – \\nLevel 1 \\n\\nAll customers are divided into 2 buckets \\n1.

('158', '67', 'assistant', '### How portfolio rebalancing is done in the application\n\n#### 1. Define rebalancing tolerance at model level\n\nDuring model portfolio creation/maintenance, the user configures a **tolerance** field for the model. This tolerance explicitly controls when rebalancing should occur: \n- The model setup includes a `Tolerance` parameter with the remark: *“Basis tolerance defined rebalancing will be done”* .\n- Asset allocation (target weights per asset class/security) is also defined as part of the model, along with risk profile, time horizon, and other attributes .\n\nIn effect, the rebalancing logic uses this stored tolerance and the target allocations to detect when the live portfolio has drifted enough to justify a rebalance.\n\n#### 2. Identify rebalancing need and create a model order\n\nWhen the system or user determines that a client’s portfolio has drifted beyond the defined tolerance for a subscribed model, a **model order** of type **Rebalancing** is initiated:\n- Transactions at model level explicitly support a `Rebalancing` transaction type alongside Purchase, Redemption, and Switch .\n- A unique **Model Order** is created with a system‑generated **Unique ID** (model order unique number). This ID acts as the umbrella identifier under which all underlying security‑level orders for that rebalance are grouped .\n- The **Model Investment Amount** (the total amount for the model after rebalance) is captured at model order level (e.g., `orderamt` in the model order initiation), from which security‑wise amounts are derived based on target allocations .\n\n#### 3. Construct the rebalancing basket (underlying MF orders)\n\nBased on the current holdings versus target allocation and the model’s tolerance setting, the system builds the **rebalancing basket**:\n- For each mutual fund/security in the model, the system compares current actual weights to target weights and calculates buy/sell quantities required to move back within tolerance.\n- The resulting actions are represented as underlying orders under the model order:\n  - For pure buy/sell at fund level, underlying orders appear as **Purchase** or **Redemption** for the respective mutual fund .\n  - For changes between funds, the system can represent it as a **Switch (Rebalancing)**, where there is a **Switch Out Security Name** and **Switch In Security Name** specifically for rebalancing order types .\n- Each underlying MF order gets its own **Order ID**, but remains linked to the model’s **Unique ID** so that the rebalance is tracked as a single event at model level .\n\n#### 4. Submit, validate, and approve the rebalance\n\nOnce the rebalancing basket is prepared, the normal order lifecycle is used, applied to all underlying orders as part of the model order:\n- **Order capture & submission**: The rebalancing transaction (model order) is captured, with computed transaction amounts/units per mutual fund security .\n- **Validations**: Standard validations apply at this stage (e.g., product eligibility, risk profile checks, mandatory field checks), similar to regular mutual fund orders and model‑based orders. The system validates and generates the unique model order ID at this stage .\n- **Authorization/approval**: \n  - Submitted orders go for supervisor approval before execution, consistent with the standard mutual fund workflow .\n  - If any risk deviations or constraints exist, additional approval layers (e.g., higher‑level approvers) may be required, as per the same rule set used for standard MF transactions .\n\n#### 5. Trade execution and routing\n\nAfter approval, the system executes the rebalancing by routing all underlying orders to the product processor/RTA:\n- **Order routing**: Approved underlying orders (Purchase/Redemption/Switch) created under the Rebalancing model order are routed to the fund execution processor/RTA for fulfillment .\n- **Synchronous execution per model order**: All underlying orders under a given model order are expected to be sent together, and the **Order Date** is recorded at model level for the full rebalance set .\n- **Status tracking**: \n  - Model‑level status (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Expired, Failed) reflects the overall state of the rebalance .\n  - Each constituent order has its own **Order Status** (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Settlement Pending, Failed, Rejected, Settled), **Trade Date**, and amount, all visible for monitoring and exception handling .\n\n#### 6. Settlement and portfolio update\n\nWhen the RTA/trade file is received, the holdings are updated to reflect the completed rebalance:\n- **Settlement**: The system processes settlement files from the RTA/product processor and updates the customer’s mutual fund holdings accordingly, following the same settlement flow used for standard MF transactions .\n- **Portfolio realignment**: \n  - Post‑settlement, the client portfolio linked to the model reflects the new holdings and weights, now realigned closer to the model’s target allocation and within the specified tolerance.\n  - The model order’s final status is updated (e.g., Settled) once all underlying orders in the rebalancing basket are settled .\n\n#### 7. Monitoring and reporting\n\nThe rebalancing event and its underlying transactions are visible in the order monitoring and reporting views:\n- The **Order Book** can be searched and viewed by model name/ID, allowing users to see all orders placed within a model, including those with **Rebalancing** transaction type .\n- Model‑level fields like Model Name, Portfolio Name, Model Investment Amount, and Model Investment Status help track and audit each rebalance instance  .\n\nOverall, portfolio rebalancing in the application is executed as a **model order of type Rebalancing**, governed by the tolerance defined in model portfolio maintenance, decomposed into underlying mutual‑fund orders, processed through the standard MF order lifecycle (validation, approval, routing, settlement), and tracked end‑to‑end at both model and individual order level.\n\n---\n\n#### Sources\n\n- [1] JBR_Journey of Creating Model Portfolio_V1_CCV1.pdf\n- [2] JBR_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement - G073 Part A and Part B - Basket based order trigger (1).pdf\n- [3] Maybank_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement - MF_V12_CCV10_Part 1.pdf\n', '7e79fb71-de0f-407c-81da-62dc1ebf69fa', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":["Model Portfolio Maintenance","G073 - Model based order trigger","Model Portfolio – Order Placement","CRISIL Portfolio Composition Master","Portfolio Master","MF Portfolio File (Crisil)","CRISIL master","Wealth Qube","HSBC PWS","Intellect"],"seed_node_ids":["datastore:model_pf_maintenance","report:model_pf_order_placement","report:g073_model_based_order_trigger","datastore:crisil_pf_composition_master","system:model_pf_maintenance","datastore:mf_pf_file_crisil","datastore:crisil_master","system:hsbc_pws","datastore:pf_master","system:crisil_master","system:intellect","system:wealth_qube","dataentity:scm_scheme_cd","dataentity:model_pf_maintenance"],"expanded_nodes":60,"expanded_edges":116,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: how is portfolio rebalancing is done in the application?","What is the end-to-end process for portfolio rebalancing within the application, including inputs, rules, triggers, calculations, validation, approvals, and trade execution?","Describe the portfolio rebalancing workflow in the application: data inputs (current holdings, target allocations, client risk profile), rebalancing triggers (scheduled, drift thresholds, advisor instruction), calculations (allocation drift, transaction costs, tax considerations, constraints), validation and compliance checks, user interfaces and screens to initiate/monitor/approve rebalances, and the trade execution path (order generation, brokerage/fill, settlement, and audit trails), along with reporting and post-rebalance updates.","[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: how is portfolio rebalancing is done in the application?

('160', '68', 'assistant', 'Below is a cleaned-up, structured version of the raw answer. I’ve removed internal file links, kept the substance, and focused on the business flow, key data, systems, and controls.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Order Capture & Submission\n\nThe lifecycle starts when an investor (or relationship manager) places a mutual fund order.\n\n**Typical actions:**\n- Select client and investment account/folio.\n- Choose scheme (by name, ISIN, or scheme code).\n- Choose transaction type:\n  - Purchase (fresh or additional)\n  - Redemption\n  - Switch (from one scheme to another)\n  - Systematic plans (SIP, SWP, STP, etc.)\n- Enter amount or units.\n- For fresh folios, capture:\n  - Investor details (PAN, tax status, bank details, etc.)\n  - Nominee details (name, DOB, relationship, allocation %, guardian if minor).\n  - Or explicit “nomination not opted” declaration.\n\n**Key data elements:**\n- Customer ID, account/folio number.\n- Scheme code/ISIN, scheme name.\n- Transaction type (purchase/redemption/switch).\n- Amount or units.\n- Nominee details (for new folios).\n- Internal order ID.\n\nOrders may also originate from:\n- **Model portfolios / baskets**: a single model/basket order generates multiple underlying fund orders, all linked by a unique model/basket order ID.\n\nOrders are usually added to a **cart** for review and then submitted.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Order Validation & Prerequisites\n\nBefore the order moves forward, the system performs basic validations.\n\n**Core checks:**\n- All mandatory fields present and correctly formatted.\n- **KYC status**:\n  - Must be valid/approved; otherwise, hard stop.\n- **Client eligibility**:\n  - Certain tax statuses (e.g., some NRI categories) or regulatory flags may disallow MF transactions.\n- **Account setup**:\n  - Valid bank mandate/payment method for purchases.\n  - For fresh folios: PAN, bank details, nominee/opt-out, etc.\n\nIf any prerequisite fails, the order is rejected or returned to the user for correction and cannot proceed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Compliance & Fund Eligibility Checks\n\nOnce basic validation passes, the system applies product and regulatory rules.\n\n**Fund & product checks:**\n- Scheme is open and eligible for the requested transaction type.\n- Scheme master data allows:\n  - Purchases/redemptions/switches as requested.\n  - No suspension or closure for that scheme/class.\n\n**Suitability & risk checks:**\n- Compare **fund risk rating** vs. **client risk profile**:\n  - If fund risk > client risk appetite:\n    - Warning (soft stop) and possible override/approval, or\n    - Hard stop, depending on policy.\n- If client risk profile is missing/expired:\n  - New purchases/switches are blocked until updated.\n\n**Amount/units checks:**\n- Minimum investment / minimum additional purchase.\n- Minimum redemption amount/units.\n- Redemption units ≤ available units in the client’s holdings.\n\n**Soft vs. hard stops:**\n- **Hard stops**: regulatory or critical rules (e.g., invalid KYC, exceeding holdings) – order cannot proceed.\n- **Soft stops**: policy-based warnings (e.g., mild risk mismatch) – may proceed with explicit consent and/or higher-level approval.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Order Routing & Execution\n\nAfter passing checks, the order enters the execution workflow.\n\n**Internal authorization (maker-checker):**\n- Many firms require a second-level approval:\n  - Status: “Pending Approval”.\n  - Supervisor/authorizer reviews and either approves or rejects.\n- Once approved, status changes to “Authorized” and the order is eligible for routing.\n\n**External routing:**\n- Order Management System (OMS) sends the order to:\n  - An exchange-based MF platform, or\n  - Directly to the fund’s Registrar & Transfer Agent (RTA) via API/file.\n- Message typically includes:\n  - Scheme code, folio/account, amount/units.\n  - Transaction type, fresh vs. additional purchase, client identifiers.\n\n**Cut-off time control:**\n- Orders approved and routed **before fund cut-off** (e.g., 3:00 PM) get **same-day NAV**.\n- Orders after cut-off get **next business day NAV**.\n- Systems often use an internal cut-off earlier than the official one to allow processing time.\n\n**External references:**\n- On successful placement, the RTA (or exchange platform) returns an external transaction ID (e.g., **RTA Ref No.**), which is stored against the order for tracking.\n\nIf routing fails (API down, connectivity issues), the order may remain in an “Authorized but not sent” or “In Progress” state and be retried or escalated.\n\n---\n\n## 5. NAV Pricing & Unit Allocation\n\nPricing is based on the **Net Asset Value (NAV)** for the applicable trade date.\n\n**Before execution:**\n- System uses latest available NAV feeds to:\n  - Show indicative NAV.\n  - Estimate units = amount / last known NAV.\n- This is only indicative; final units depend on the official closing NAV.\n\n**At execution (RTA side):**\n- Trade date is determined by when the order reached the RTA vs. cut-off.\n- RTA calculates:\n  - Final NAV used.\n  - Exact units (for purchases) or amount (for redemptions).\n\n**Back in the wealth system:**\n- RTA sends confirmation with:\n  - Executed NAV.\n  - Units/amount.\n  - Trade date and reference numbers.\n- System updates the order with actual execution details.\n- Controls check for:\n  - Missing/stale NAV.\n  - Unusual price/unit discrepancies (beyond rounding tolerances), which are flagged for review.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Settlement with RTA / Custodian\n\nAfter execution, the transaction settles and records are updated.\n\n**Typical settlement timelines:**\n- Purchases: units allotted on T or T+1.\n- Redemptions: proceeds credited on T+1/T+2/T+3 depending on fund type and market.\n\n**Purchases:**\n- Cash is debited from client’s bank (via payment gateway, mandate, or bank integration) around order execution.\n- On settlement:\n  - RTA allots units to the investor’s folio.\n  - RTA’s records become the official unit-holder register.\n\n**Redemptions:**\n- Units are extinguished in the folio.\n- RTA credits redemption proceeds directly to the registered bank account.\n\n**System updates:**\n- Wealth system receives a **trade confirmation/contract note file** from RTA:\n  - Final units/amount.\n  - Settlement date.\n  - RTA reference numbers.\n- Order status is updated to **Settled/Completed**.\n- Client holdings are updated:\n  - Purchases: units added.\n  - Redemptions: units reduced.\n\nIf the RTA rejects the order, it is marked as **Failed/Rejected** with reason codes.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Post-Settlement Processing & Reconciliation\n\nOperations teams (or automated jobs) reconcile internal records with RTA data.\n\n**Transaction reconciliation:**\n- Match each internal order with RTA confirmation using:\n  - Scheme code.\n  - Folio number.\n  - Transaction reference.\n  - Units/amount and dates.\n- Outcomes:\n  - **Matched**: all key fields align.\n  - **Differential match**: minor differences (e.g., rounding) within tolerance.\n  - **Unmatched/Exception**: no corresponding record or material differences.\n\n**New folios:**\n- For fresh purchases, RTA may create a new folio number.\n- Reconciliation logic:\n  - Identifies that the RTA record matches an internal order (by client, scheme, amount, date).\n  - Updates the internal record with the **new folio number**.\n  - Marks the order as matched and completed.\n\n**Exception handling in reconciliation:**\n- Unmatched items:\n  - RTA record with no internal order (out-of-band transaction).\n  - Internal order with no RTA confirmation.\n- These are flagged for manual investigation and correction.\n\nAfter reconciliation, the wealth system’s holdings are treated as synchronized with RTA records.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Exception Handling & Remediation\n\nExceptions can occur at multiple stages.\n\n**Validation/compliance failures:**\n- Immediate feedback to user (e.g., “KYC not valid”, “Minimum amount not met”).\n- Order cannot proceed until corrected.\n\n**Payment failures (purchases):**\n- **Business rejections** (e.g., insufficient funds, incorrect account):\n  - Order marked **Failed** with specific reason.\n- **Technical failures** (e.g., network/API errors):\n  - Order kept in “In Progress” or similar status.\n  - System retries debits and/or queries bank/payment status periodically.\n  - If still unresolved near cut-off, order is marked **Failed** to avoid late submission.\n\n**RTA-level failures:**\n- RTA rejects order due to data issues, limits, or regulatory reasons.\n- Status updated to “Rejected by RTA” with reason code.\n- In baskets, some legs may succeed while others fail; each order is tracked individually.\n\n**Operational remediation:**\n- For persistent technical issues, operations may:\n  - Manually upload orders to RTA/exchange portals.\n  - Manually correct data and re-book where allowed.\n\nClients and internal teams are typically notified (email/SMS/alerts) when orders fail or are rejected.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Audit Trails, Approvals & Governance\n\nStrong governance is embedded throughout the lifecycle.\n\n**Maker-checker approvals:**\n- Front-office (maker) enters orders.\n- Approver (checker) reviews:\n  - Client, scheme, amount, risk flags, exceptions.\n- Approver can:\n  - Approve → status changes to “Authorized”.\n  - Reject → order canceled, not routed.\n\n**Escalated approvals:**\n- For exceptions (e.g., product risk > client risk, large ticket sizes), additional approvals may be required:\n  - Compliance officer.\n  - Senior manager / regional head.\n\n**Audit trail:**\n- Every significant action is logged:\n  - Who created, modified, approved, or rejected the order.\n  - Timestamps for each action.\n  - Old vs. new values where applicable.\n  - Status changes (e.g., Pending → Authorized → Sent → Settled/Failed).\n- Logs are tamper-resistant and retained for regulatory timeframes.\n\nThis ensures full traceability for internal governance and external audits.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Reporting & Regulatory Records\n\nThe final stage focuses on communication and long-term record-keeping.\n\n**Client reporting:**\n- Real-time notifications:\n  - Order placement acknowledgments.\n  - Execution/settlement confirmations.\n  - Rejection/failure notices.\n- Periodic reports:\n  - Portfolio statements showing updated MF holdings.\n  - Transaction statements.\n\n**Internal reporting:**\n- Order book dashboards:\n  - All orders with status (Pending, Authorized, Sent, Settled, Failed).\n  - Filters by client, RM, scheme, date, etc.\n- Reconciliation and exception reports for operations.\n- Management and risk reports (e.g., volumes, exceptions, breaches).\n\n**Regulatory records & retention:**\n- Long-term storage of:\n  - Order details and confirmations.\n  - Audit logs (maker/checker, overrides).\n  - Client communications (where required).\n- Retention aligned with regulations (e.g., 5–7+ years).\n- Ability to export data (CSV, PDF, etc.) for regulators or auditors.\n- Generation of regulatory reports (e.g., periodic trade reports, tax/FATCA-related reports) in prescribed formats.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe mutual fund order management lifecycle runs from order capture and validation, through compliance checks, approvals, routing, NAV-based execution, settlement and reconciliation, to exception handling, audit, and reporting. Each stage is supported by specific data elements, system interfaces (OMS, RTA, custodians, NAV feeds, payment systems), and controls (cut-off times, risk/suitability rules, maker-checker, soft/hard stops, and detailed audit trails).', 'resp_0dfde5da6d5af33700693db3755f7c8192a9158563f6104073', NULL, '{"polled":true,"poll_status":"completed","domainResolution":{"domainId":"wealth_management","strategy":"classifier","confidence":0.08,"matchedKeywords":["mutual fund"]},"jobId":"job_1765651319415_3j8nnn63b","status":"completed","responseId":"resp_0dfde5da6d5af33700693db3755f7c8192a9158563f6104073"}', '2025-12-13 18:41:58.999919'),

Transition from Email Verification to Authenticated Session\n\n1. **Email verification via OTP or link**  \n   - The user provides the email address and receives a one-time code or verification link.  \n   - The user must correctly enter the OTP or access the link within a defined validity window to complete verification .\n\n2. **No direct full access on verification alone**  \n   - Email verification is treated as **identity proofing** for the channel, not as a full login.  \n   - After successful verification, the user is redirected to the login/credential‑setup step rather than being silently logged into a full session.\n\n### 2. Required Authentication Steps After Email Verification\n\nImmediately after email verification, the recommended flow is:\n\n1. **Initial credential setup or confirmation**  \n   - If this is a first‑time user: prompt to **set a strong password/PIN** that meets policy (length, complexity, disallow reuse, etc.).  \n   - If the user already has credentials: prompt a **standard login** (user ID + password) using the now-verified email for account association.\n\n2. **Multi‑Factor Authentication (MFA)**  \n   - For first login after email verification, enforce **step‑up MFA** (OTP to mobile/email, or app-based token) in addition to password.  \n   - The same OTP pattern as used in onboarding (e.g., send OTP, user inputs OTP on verification screen) can be reused for MFA, but with distinct purpose/labels .\n\n3. **Session creation only after successful password + MFA**  \n   - An authenticated application session is established **only after both** password authentication and MFA succeed.  \n   - Prior steps (email verification screens) run in a pre‑auth, limited session that does not expose customer or portfolio data.\n\n### 3. Session Management Immediately Post‑Verification\n\n1. **Session start and scope**  \n   - The authenticated session starts once the user completes password login and mandatory MFA.  \n   - Default session scope should provide access to general dashboards and non-transactional views, with **separate step‑up prompts for high‑risk actions** (e.g., order placement, changes to risk profile, entitlements).\n\n2. **Session timeout and idle limits**  \n   - Set a **shorter idle timeout** for the **first session after email verification** (e.g., 5–10 minutes of inactivity) to limit exposure if the environment or device is not yet trusted.  \n   - Enforce an **absolute session lifetime** regardless of activity (e.g., 30–60 minutes) before re‑authentication is required for any further access.\n\n3. **Re-authentication for sensitive actions**  \n   - Before the user performs security‑sensitive or risk‑sensitive actions (e.g., changing contact details, submitting a high‑risk purchase order), prompt for:  \n     - Password re‑entry and/or  \n     - Another OTP/app‑based factor.  \n   - This aligns with risk‑based controls already defined for product and customer risk, where deviations trigger warnings or hard stops during order journeys .\n\n### 4. Device and Risk-Based Access Controls\n\n1. **Basic device and channel checks**  \n   - Tag the device/browser at the time of the first post‑verification login (user agent, IP, geo metadata).  \n   - If the device/geo appears anomalous vs. typical usage, **force MFA** even if the user later marks the device as trusted.\n\n2. **Trusted device flag with constraints**  \n   - Optionally allow the user to mark a device as **trusted** (e.g., suppress some MFA prompts for low‑risk actions).  \n   - Even on trusted devices, **always require MFA** for high‑risk actions like placing orders in products with higher product risk profile than the customer’s risk profile or modifying key profile attributes .\n\n3. **Risk-aware access controls**  \n   - Ensure that once logged in, all transactional screens (e.g., purchase/order flows) continue to apply **risk profile validations**, preventing orders where product risk exceeds the customer’s risk tolerance beyond allowed thresholds .  \n   - Alert and notification configurations for risk mismatches and exceptional cases (e.g., product risk > customer risk by X levels) should remain active from the very first session .\n\n### 5. Role-Based Access and Entitlements\n\n1. **Role derivation post-verification**  \n   - Upon authenticated login, the system resolves the user’s **role and entitlements** (e.g., customer, RM, supervisor) from central maintenance/definition modules .  \n   - Screens, menus, and actions exposed in this first session must strictly follow these entitlements.\n\n2. **Segregation of duties and approvals**  \n   - For actions that require additional approvals (e.g., orders with higher risk deviation), ensure the same multi‑level authorization logic applies from the first post‑verification session, routing orders to supervisors or heads as configured .\n\n### 6. System-Generated Communication and Notifications\n\n1. **Confirmation mails/messages**  \n   - After email verification and first successful authenticated access, send a **system-generated notification** (email/SMS/in‑app) confirming:  \n     - Email verified successfully.  \n     - Date/time and channel of first secure login.\n\n2. **Security alerts**  \n   - If an unusual device/location is detected, generate alerts to the user and/or internal monitoring teams, using the existing alert/notification framework that also handles product‑risk and exception alerts .\n\n### 7. Logging and Audit Requirements\n\nDuring the immediate post‑email‑verification period, ensure that the following events are fully logged and auditable:\n\n1. **Verification and authentication events**  \n   - Email verification request and outcome (success/failure) with timestamp and channel .  \n   - Password setup/change events.  \n   - All login attempts, MFA challenges, and results.\n\n2. **Session lifecycle events**  \n   - Session creation (with correlation to email-verified identity).  \n   - Session termination due to explicit logout, idle timeout, or absolute timeout.\n\n3. **Security‑relevant actions**  \n   - Changes to customer profile that affect risk assessment, limits, or contact details (based on defined maintenance and role modules) .  \n   - Any order or purchase attempts where product risk is higher than customer risk, including triggered warnings, hard stops, and approvals  .\n\n4. **Entitlement and configuration changes (back-office)**  \n   - Although not done by the end user during this session, any changes to roles, service groups, or alert definitions that could affect how the user is controlled should also be audited in the same ecosystem .\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nImmediately after email verification, the application should:\n\n- Treat verification as a **pre‑auth step**, not a full login.  \n- Require **password authentication plus MFA** before creating a full session.  \n- Start a **tightly controlled initial session** (short idle and absolute timeouts), with step‑up re‑authentication for sensitive actions.  \n- Apply **risk-aware validations** (e.g., product vs. customer risk profile) and standard role-based entitlements from the first session  .  \n- Generate **system notifications** for verification and first secure login, and comprehensively **log/audit** all verification, authentication, session, and risk-relevant actions.\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] HSBC_DIY_Journey of Customer Onboarding V10.pdf  \n[2] IIFL_Journey of Defining Maintenance_V10_CCV13_Part 1.pdf  \n[3] 360One_Journey of Creating Model Portfolio_V11_CCV13.pdf  \n[4] SBI_Journey of Defining Maintenances__V10.pdf  \n[5] SBI_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement - MF V10_SBI_CCV13.pdf', 'd91b121e-5ac3-40dd-897b-23e557cf2ff5', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":["OTP verification screen","Login","User Office Landing Screen","system generated mail","Notification to User screen"],"seed_node_ids":["system:generated_mail","report:login","dataentity:login","report:otp_verification_screen","report:user_office_landing_screen","report:notification_to_user_screen"],"expanded_nodes":16,"expanded_edges":639,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: d91b121e-5ac3-40dd-897b-23e557cf2ff5\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('180', '78', 'assistant', '## Comprehensive Report on Portfolio Rebalancing in Wealth Management Systems\n\n### Introduction\n\nPortfolio rebalancing is a fundamental aspect of wealth management, designed to realign investment portfolios with pre-defined financial strategies and risk profiles. This report provides a detailed analysis of the processes, triggers, decision-making logic, governance, execution, and compliance involved in portfolio rebalancing within sophisticated wealth management platforms.\n\n### 1. Eligible Portfolios & Instruments\n\n#### Eligible Client Portfolios\n- Portfolios eligible for rebalancing are typically those enrolled in:\n  - **Model-Based Rebalancing**: Automated adjustments based on a pre-set model strategy.\n  - **Discretionary Rebalancing**: Managed by a financial advisor with discretionary powers.\n  \n- **Mapping to Models**: Each investment account must link to a specific model portfolio that defines target allocations and permissible variances.\n\n#### Instruments\n- Primarily involves **mutual funds** and other financial instruments as defined in the investment model:\n  - **Target Allocation Weights**: Specific percentage allocations for asset classes.\n  - **Eligible Securities**: List of approved securities for each model.\n\n- **Security Master Data**: Utilizes a centralized feed (e.g., CRISIL) to gather:\n  - Minimum transaction limits.\n  - Permitted transaction types (purchase, redemption, switch).\n  - Applicable constraints and compliance regulations.\n\n### 2. Rebalancing Triggers\n\n#### Types of Triggers\n1. **Scheduled (Time-Based) Rebalancing**\n   - Occurs periodically (quarterly, annually) to maintain alignment with strategic objectives.\n   \n2. **Threshold-Based (Drift) Rebalancing**\n   - Initiated when asset allocations vary beyond predefined tolerance levels.\n   - Ensures the portfolio remains risk-appropriate.\n\n3. **Event/Risk-Based Rebalancing**\n   - Triggered by significant changes in the market or in the client’s risk assessment.\n   - Responds to external alerts or shifts in economic indicators.\n\n4. **Model Updates**\n   - Any modifications to the underlying model (e.g., changes in target weights) prompt a realignment of all associated portfolios.\n\n5. **Automatic vs. Manual Initiation**\n   - **Automatic Rebalancing**: System-initiated for clients opting into auto services.\n   - **Advisor-Initiated**: Requires advisor approval for clients electing manual control.\n\n### 3. Decision Logic & Portfolio Adjustments\n\n#### Rebalancing Engine\n- Compares existing holdings against model targets to determine necessary trades.\n- Prioritizes changes that exceed tolerance bands to avoid unnecessary turnover.\n\n#### Optimization and Efficiency\n- **Switch Transactions**: Combines redemption and purchase when possible within the same fund family to enhance cost efficiency.\n- Separate transactions for different AMCs or unsupported fund switches.\n\n#### Verification\n- Ensures compliance with security master constraints and internal rules.\n- Highlights transactions violating tax-saving lock-ins or cut-off restrictions for correction.\n\n### 4. Governance & Approvals\n\n#### Approval Process\n- **Maker-Checker Workflows**: Dual-approval requirement ensures oversight on large rebalance actions.\n  \n#### Role-Based Entitlements\n- Permissions based on user roles; only authorized users execute or approve rebalancing.\n- Advisors manage only their own client portfolios.\n\n#### Model Governance\n- Investment committee or similar entities must approve model changes before implementation.\n- Once approved, system-driven automatic adjustments occur across affected portfolios.\n\n### 5. Order Execution & Settlement\n\n#### Order Creation\n- Converts the rebalancing plan into specific client-level orders for transactions like buy, sell, or switch.\n- Orders are tracked under a unique reference for coordination.\n\n#### Execution & Payments\n- Routes through integrated systems to exchanges or fund platforms.\n- Automated payment processing for purchases; proceeds from sales directed to designated accounts.\n\n#### Cut-Off and Monitoring\n- Adheres to cut-off rules; delays transactions as needed while making necessary adjustments to order status and execution.\n\n#### Exception Handling\n- Captures and rectifies failed or rejected orders through automated or manual interventions.\n\n### 6. Post-Trade Reconciliation & Compliance\n\n#### Reconciliation\n- Validates executed trades align with planned adjustments, ensuring allocations return within target bands.\n  \n#### Audit Trail\n- Comprehensive logging supports regulatory audits by recording all actions, decisions, and outcomes.\n\n#### Client Communication\n- Generates detailed reports and notifications for clients, detailing the rebalance actions and new portfolio composition.\n\n### Sources & References\n\n1.

('182', '78', 'assistant', '## Overview\n\nA user can automatically generate a list of target leads by defining **lead rules** that filter existing customer records in the wealth platform. The system applies these rules to customer data (e.g., CRM, profiles, AUM, behavior) and produces a **lead list** that can be used for campaigns or RM follow-ups. This is typically handled through a **Lead List Management** and **Automatic Lead Generation** capability within the platform   .\n\n---\n\n## 1. Accessing Lead List Management and Automatic Lead Generation\n\n1. The user navigates to the **Campaign / Lead Management** area and selects **Lead List Management**.\n2. Within Lead List Management, they choose **Automatic Lead Generation** as the method to create a list of target customers from existing records in the wealth system  .\n\nAutomatic Lead Generation specifically:\n- Uses customers already **onboarded / present in the wealth system** as the source population.\n- Relies on **filter criteria** defined by the user in a rule definition interface to select potential targets .\n\n---\n\n## 2. Defining Lead Rules (Segmentation Criteria)\n\n### 2.1 Lead Rule Setup\n\nThe user works in a **Lead Rule** or **Lead Criteria** setup screen, which is used to define how existing customer records will be filtered to create a list of potential targets for a campaign   .\n\nFrom this screen, they can:\n- **Add a new lead rule**.\n- **View existing lead rules**.\n- **Modify existing lead rules**.\n- **Trigger list generation** for a given rule   .\n\n### 2.2 Selecting Criteria and Operations\n\nWithin the lead rule definition, the user:\n\n1. **Selects a data attribute (criteria)** from a dropdown list—for example:\n   - AUM or total relationship value.\n   - Product holdings or product gaps.\n   - Demographics (age band, geography, segment).\n   - Channel or contact preferences.\n2. **Chooses a mathematical or logical operation** such as `Greater`, `Less`, `Equal`, `Between`, `Contains`, etc.\n3. **Enters the criteria value** (e.g., AUM > 1,000,000) to define the threshold or matching value. An example in the documentation is: Criteria = *Total AUM/Credit*, Operation = *Greater*, Value = *1,000,000* .\n4. Repeats this for multiple conditions and combines them using logical AND/OR (as supported by the rules interface) to build more complex segmentation.\n\nThis rules engine can conceptually support criteria across:\n- **Account and relationship data** (account type, segment, booking center).\n- **AUM and portfolio data** (overall AUM, holdings in particular products, under-penetration in certain products).\n- **Investment preferences and risk profile** (risk rating, product bans, suitability flags).\n- **Demographic attributes** (age, occupation, region).\n- **Behavioral signals** (recent transactions, inactivity, campaign responses) – typically sourced from CRM and transaction history.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Applying Rules Across Data Sources\n\nWhen the user saves or runs a lead rule, the platform’s rules engine:\n\n1. **Reads customer master and profile data** from the core CRM/onboarding system (e.g., name, segment, demographics, mapped RM, risk profile) .\n2. **Uses holdings/AUM and transaction data** from the wealth system—customers are described as "existing customers present/onboarded in the wealth system" and are the basis for filtering  .\n3. **Applies the filter criteria** defined in the lead rule over this combined dataset to identify which customers match the criteria for the campaign.\n4. **Produces a filtered set of customer records** as the candidate lead pool, which is then associated to a new or existing lead list.\n\nThis mechanism abstracts away the underlying data sources (CRM, client master, transaction store) and exposes them as selectable criteria to the user through dropdowns and operators .\n\n---\n\n## 4. Managing Lead Rules\n\nFrom the **View All Lead Rules** screen, the user can manage rule lifecycle   :\n\n- **View existing rules:** Inspect the criteria definition and status.\n- **Add lead rule:** Create a new segmentation rule for a specific campaign or product.\n- **Modify lead rule:** Update thresholds (e.g., AUM bands) or conditions as strategy changes.\n- **Generate list:** Execute the rule to refresh or create a lead list with up-to-date customers.\n\nThis supports continuous refinement of targeting logic without IT intervention.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Generating and Using the Lead List\n\n### 5.1 Generate List Action\n\nWhen the user selects **Generate List** for a given lead rule:\n\n1. The system runs the rule against the current customer base.\n2. It **displays the filtered customer records** that meet the defined criteria—these constitute the target leads for the campaign   .\n3. A **Lead List** object is created or updated, containing these leads for further campaign actions (such as assignment, calling, or digital communication).\n\n### 5.2 Lead List Management\n\nWithin Lead List Management, users can typically:\n- View different lead lists associated with campaigns.\n- Modify a list (e.g., add/remove specific leads, change status).\n- Merge multiple lead lists into a single consolidated list for broader campaigns .\n\n### 5.3 Output and Integration\n\nAlthough the documents describe list management within the platform UI, the generated lead lists can be conceptually:\n- **Consumed directly in the CRM module** for allocation to RMs or contact centers.\n- **Exported** (e.g., in a format suitable for CSV download or batch import) to external campaign tools, subject to platform capabilities.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Scheduling and Automation Considerations\n\nThe core referenced flows focus on **on-demand generation** via the Generate List action, but the same rules framework is suited for scheduling:\n\n- Define a lead rule once (e.g., "High AUM clients without product X").\n- Configure it to run at defined intervals (daily/weekly/monthly) using a scheduler component, so that new qualifying customers are automatically added to the associated lead list.\n- Notify users (e.g., campaign managers or RMs) when a list refresh completes.\n\nThis approach ensures ongoing, automated identification of target leads without manual re-definition of criteria.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Validations, Data Quality, and Error Handling\n\nTypical validations and checks around automatic lead generation include:\n\n- **Rule definition validation:**\n  - Ensuring mandatory fields (criteria, operation, value) are provided.\n  - Checking that combinations of criteria are syntactically and logically valid (e.g., no conflicting operators).\n- **Data existence and type checks:**\n  - Making sure the selected attributes exist for all or most customers; dealing gracefully with missing or null values.\n- **Upload vs. automatic generation:**\n  - In addition to automatic generation, the platform supports **Lead Upload**, where users can upload external lists and then review an **error log** to see invalid or rejected entries, which illustrates the use of validation and error reporting whenever new leads are created or updated .\n\nThese same principles apply to automatically generated lists—invalid or incomplete customer records should be handled consistently and, where relevant, flagged for data remediation before being used in campaigns.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Privacy, Consent, and Compliance\n\nWhen automatically generating lead lists from existing customers, the workflow must be constrained by privacy and regulatory requirements, for example:\n\n- **Use only permitted data:** Ensure that the criteria use data that is allowed for marketing or sales targeting, in line with consent, internal policies, and local regulations.\n- **Respect customer contact preferences:** Before a customer is added to a callable/emailable lead list, check do-not-contact flags or communication preferences stored in the customer profile.\n- **Purpose limitation:** Use segmentation and lead generation only for permitted purposes (e.g., servicing, suitable cross-sell) and not beyond what the customer has consented to.\n- **Auditability:** Maintain an audit trail showing:\n  - Which rules were run.\n  - When a lead list was generated or refreshed.\n  - Which users initiated changes to rules or lists.\n\nThese controls sit alongside the functional lead-rule and list-management flows to ensure compliant use of customer data.\n\n---\n\n## 9. End-to-End Automated Lead Generation Flow (Summary)\n\n1. **Access Lead List Management** and select **Automatic Lead Generation**.\n2. **Create or select a lead rule** in the Lead Rule setup screen.\n3. **Define criteria** (e.g., AUM, product holdings/gaps, demographics, behavior) using dropdown attributes, operations, and values .\n4. **Save the rule** and optionally configure a schedule (if supported) for periodic execution.\n5. **Run “Generate List”** to apply the rule to existing onboarded customers and produce a filtered set of records as a **lead list**   .\n6. **Review and manage the lead list** (view, refine, merge lists, export or feed into CRM/campaign tools) .\n7. **Apply validations and compliance checks** (data quality, consent, contact preferences, audit trail) before executing outbound campaigns.\n\nThis provides a structured, repeatable, and largely automated way for wealth-management users to generate targeted lead lists based on specific customer criteria.\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] HSBC_Journey of Suspect to Lead_V10_CCV13docx.pdf   \n[2] 360One_Journey of Suspect to Lead_V10_CCV10docx.pdf   \n[3] SBI_Journey of Suspect to Lead_V10_CCV13.pdf ', 'resp_0c5ec1f943dff3bb00693f021f163081a29cbb5a910126e9fa', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":["Lead","Customer Search","My Customers","INVESTOR","RM","Customer Dashboard","Risk Profile Questionnaire","Focus Funds","Mutual Funds","Product risk profile"],"seed_node_ids":["report:risk_profile_questionnaire","dataentity:lead","system:rmws","dataentity:risk_profile_questionnaire","report:customer_dashboard","datastore:focus_funds","report:my_customers","dataentity:rm","dataentity:mutual_funds","dataentity:investor","dataentity:fund_cut_off_time","report:customer_search","dataentity:product_risk_profile"],"expanded_nodes":83,"expanded_edges":181,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: resp_0c5ec1f943dff3bb00693f021f163081a29cbb5a910126e9fa\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('202', '81', 'assistant', 'Bulk transfer of client ownership across agents is supported through delegated handover functionality in the Operations Office. The feature enables an Operations User Maker to temporarily or permanently reassign leads, prospects, and customers from one relationship manager (RM) to another, with specific UI paths and safeguards in place.\n\nKey concepts and capabilities\n- Delegation and handover foundations: Delegation allows temporary reassignment of leads, prospects, and customers between RMs under the same Operations User Maker, typically used when a RM is unavailable, with auto-authorization in some configurations. This supports bulk reassignment workflows when a large group of clients needs to move to a new agent in one action or within a single delegation session [1].\n- Distinct delegation modes: The system exposes tabs for Lead Delegation, Prospect Delegation, and Client Delegation to organize bulk moves by client type, helping users apply the transfer to a broad set of records in a controlled manner [1]. In contrast, handover is designed for permanent reassignment (e.g., a RM exiting or a client-initiated change of RM) and is performed via a dedicated handover path in the Relationship area, with similar bulk-selection capabilities [2].\n\nHow to perform a bulk transfer (high-level steps)\n1) Access path and scope\n- Open the Operations/Relationship area and navigate to Delegation (for temporary reassignment) or Handover (for permanent reassignment) depending on the business need. This path is the standard entry point for bulk ownership changes and is documented as the main UI for bulk client transfers [1][2].\n\n2) Define source and destination\n- In the Delegation/Handover screen, specify the source agent (current RM) and the destination agent (new RM). The transfer operates within the governance boundaries of the Operations User Maker role [1].\n\n3) Bulk selection or filtering\n- Use the provided filters to identify the eligible client set (e.g., by status, ownership, product holdings, or other criteria). The UI supports selecting multiple clients and reflecting them in a Selected Clients List for bulk processing [2].\n- After filtering, you can review the Selected Clients List to confirm the bulk set before applying the transfer [2].\n\n4) Execute the bulk transfer\n- Confirm the transfer action. Delegation can be auto-authorized in some configurations, enabling a seamless bulk move without per-client approvals, while handover may require explicit action for permanent reassignment [1].\n\n5) Audit and traceability\n- Every delegation or handover action is captured in an audit trail. You can view the audit entries and download them (e.g., as XLS) to satisfy governance and regulatory requirements [3]. Additional audit trail documentation highlights IDs, timestamps, and the ability to export logs for review [4].\n\n6) Data integrity and regulatory constraints\n- Transfers are governed by permissions/entitlements, ensuring only authorized users can perform bulk reassignments. Delegation is designed to maintain a clear ownership lineage under the controlling Operations User Maker, with scope limited to the appropriate relationship group (e.g., RM within the same operational hierarchy) [1].\n- For permanent reassignment (handover), the process is intended to reflect a lasting change of ownership, and it is documented to support scenarios like RM exits or client-requested changes, reinforcing data integrity and accountability [2].\n- Audit trails provide the necessary evidence and accountability for transfers, enabling downstream reconciliation and regulatory reporting [3].\n\nPractical implications and best practices\n- Use bulk delegation for temporary coverage or large-scale reassignment when the business need is time-bound, leveraging the automated/auto-authorized flow where permitted to reduce manual steps [1].\n- Prefer handover for permanent ownership changes to ensure a lasting, auditable record of the new owner and associated responsibilities [2].\n- Always validate the transfer through the audit trail post-action, and export or review the logs as part of governance and regulatory compliance activities [3].\n\nIn short, bulk client ownership transfer from one agent to another is supported via Delegation/Handover workflows, with UI paths to filter and bulk-select clients, controlled permissions, and comprehensive audit trails to ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance [1][2][3][4].\n\nSources\n- HSBC_Handover and Delegation_V10_CCV11.pdf [1]\n- JBR_Handover and Delegation_V10_CCV11.pdf [2]\n- Maybank_Audit Trail_V13_CCV12.pdf [3]\n- SBI_Audit Trail_V10.pdf [4]', '9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Pending Approval Listing","To Approve tab","Supervisor Approval screen","User Office","INVESTOR","RM","Order","customer","Product Cart","External Systems"],"seed_node_ids":["datastore:pending_approval_listing","system:user_office","system:rmws","report:performance_projection","datastore:product_cart","system:product_cart","system:to_approve_tab","dataentity:pending_approval_listing","dataentity:investor","dataentity:rm","dataentity:order","dataentity:product_cart","dataentity:customer","system:external_systems","report:product_cart","system:supervisor_approval_screen"],"expanded_nodes":52,"expanded_edges":83,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: 9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('229', '84', 'assistant', '## Secure access immediately after email verification\n\nImmediately after the user verifies their email (typically via an OTP sent to the registered address), the application should *not* treat the user as fully authenticated for transactional access yet. Instead, it should follow a short, controlled sequence that upgrades the user from "verified contact" to "authenticated application user".\n\n### 1. Complete email verification with a time‑bound OTP\n- The user enters their email address and requests an OTP.\n- A one‑time password is generated and sent to the registered email ID via a system‑generated email, with clear instructions and limited validity (e.g., a few minutes). \n- On the Email Verification screen, the user inputs the OTP; the system validates it and marks the email as verified in the user record.\n\n**Security controls:**\n- OTP is single‑use, time‑bound, and bound to the specific onboarding session and email ID. \n- Limited retry attempts; on exceeding retries or expiry, the OTP must be regenerated, and the old one invalidated.\n\n### 2. Transition from “verified email” to “first secure access”\nOnce the OTP is successfully validated, the user should be led through *one controlled step* to obtain secure application access:\n\n1. **If credentials are not yet created (typical DIY onboarding):**\n   - Redirect the user to a *First‑Time Login / Set Credentials* screen.\n   - Require the user to set a strong login password (and optionally a PIN or security questions) that meets configured complexity rules.\n   - Bind the new credentials to the user profile just created during onboarding.\n\n2. **If credentials already exist (e.g., pre‑created by operations / User Office):**\n   - Show a confirmation screen that email is verified.\n   - Prompt the user to proceed to the standard Login screen and authenticate with existing credentials.\n\nIn both cases, **successful login after email verification** is what actually establishes the authenticated session; email verification alone does not. \n\n### 3. Authentication and session establishment\nAfter email verification and (if needed) credential setup, the next step is a proper login:\n\n- The user accesses the **Login** screen and enters their username (or registered email/ID) and password.\n- The system authenticates against the user directory / user maintenance layer, enforcing password policies and lockout rules.\n- On success, a secure session is created (e.g., via session token/cookie) with:\n  - An idle timeout.\n  - A hard session expiry.\n  - Device/browser binding where required (e.g., flagging new devices for additional checks).\n\n**First‑login hardening (post‑verification):**\n- Enforce password reset on first login if credentials were system‑generated and sent via email/SMS.\n- Optionally trigger a step‑up factor (e.g., OTP to email or mobile) for the very first authenticated session, then mark the device as trusted.\n\n### 4. Entitlement activation after secure login\nOnly *after* a successful authenticated login should business entitlements be activated:\n\n- The platform applies actor/entitlement rules to determine what the user can see and do (e.g., which dashboards, which accounts, which transactions). \n- Based on role and entitlements, the user is routed to the appropriate landing screen (e.g., Customer Dashboard, STP dashboard, or RM/Back‑office workspace).  \n- Transactional journeys such as STP, SWP, or order placement are enabled only if the user’s role and account status meet prerequisites and validations defined in the platform. \n\n### 5. Landing on the Customer Dashboard / workspace\nOnce authenticated and entitled, the user is directed to the relevant workspace:\n\n- For an end customer in a DIY journey, the **Customer Dashboard** typically becomes the default landing screen after login, displaying portfolio, holdings, and other summary details. \n- For an RM or internal user, the system may redirect to an RM office or equivalent workspace, from which they can open a Customer Dashboard or other tools.\n- In onboarding journeys where KYC or other steps are still pending, the system may allow **view‑only** or limited‑function dashboards until all prerequisites are complete. \n\n### 6. Role of related systems and components\nWithin this flow, various logical components play distinct roles:\n\n- **Login / Authentication layer**\n  - Handles credential verification, first‑time login, password changes, and enforcement of security policies.\n  - Issues and maintains the authenticated session token.\n\n- **User maintenance / User Office**\n  - Maintains user master data (IDs, contact details, status, roles, and entitlements).\n  - May pre‑create users, trigger initial credential generation, and manage lifecycle events (activation, lock, disable).\n\n- **System‑generated mail & Email body**\n  - Delivers OTPs for verification and other notifications (e.g., transactional emails in later journeys). \n  - The email body templates convey purpose, masking sensitive data, and confirm that the message is system‑generated (no reply).\n\n- **Core wealth / transaction platform (e.g., STP, order journeys)**\n  - Exposes post‑login transaction journeys (STP, SWP, purchases, redemptions) that rely on authenticated user context and entitlements. \n  - Performs field‑level and business validations before allowing orders.\n\n- **Dashboards and desks (Customer Dashboard, Customer Profile Desk)**\n  - Provide a consolidated, post‑login view of the customer’s data and activities.\n  - Act as a secure entry point into holdings, orders, and other detailed screens. \n\n### 7. Recommended control summary for “immediate post‑verification access”\nTo specifically answer *how a user secures access immediately after email verification*:\n\n1. Verify email using a time‑bound OTP sent via system‑generated mail.\n2. Upon successful verification:\n   - If no credentials exist, force the user into a one‑time credential setup screen, with strong password rules.\n   - If credentials exist, instruct the user to proceed to the standard Login screen.\n3.

('231', '84', 'assistant', '## RM lead/performance views – sorting logic for Relationship Managers\n\n### 1. Is there a dedicated "RM lead‑performance" list and its sort logic?\nIn the available specifications, RM dashboards and customer dashboards describe how data related to customers, activities, alerts, and notes can be filtered and sorted, but they **do not define a dedicated screen that ranks or lists Relationship Managers by lead performance with a specific multi‑field sorting logic** (e.g., conversion rate, pipeline value, activity recency).\n\nDocuments for RM dashboards focus on:\n- RM viewing and sorting their *own* activities (e.g., To‑Dos by status or date) \n- Supervisors and RMs accessing dashboards and self/supervisor assessment journeys, but without detailing an RM‑by‑RM performance ranking sort order\n\nGiven the available material, there is **no explicit, standardised sorting algorithm documented for an RM list ordered by lead performance** (no stated primary metric, direction, or tie‑break fields).\n\n### 2. Documented sorting behaviour in related views\nWhile the RM lead‑performance list itself is not specified, several related patterns are documented that show how sorting is generally handled in dashboards:\n\n1. **Customer lists on customer dashboards**\n   - Users can sort customers in **ascending or descending order by customer name (alphabetical)**. This is explicitly mentioned for customer lists in customer dashboards, where filters exist for RM/Agent name, AUM, and other attributes, and a generic "Sort" option sorts by name.  \n   - This suggests that where no explicit performance ranking is defined, the default pattern is a simple, user‑initiated sort by an identifier (typically name) with direction toggle.\n\n2. **Activity and notes lists on RM dashboards**\n   - To‑Do items can be **sorted by status or date**, with the RM choosing the sort criterion; this is a per‑widget, user‑driven sort rather than a fixed business ranking. \n   - Notes can also be sorted (criteria not deeply specified, but pattern is that the user selects the sort option on the widget). \n\nThese patterns indicate that, in similar list‑type widgets, sorting is **simple, single‑field, and often user‑selectable**, not multi‑metric ranking with complex tie‑break rules.\n\n### 3. What can be stated about RM lead‑performance sorting\nBased on the above and the absence of a specific RM ranking spec:\n\n- **Primary sort field and direction:**\n  - No document defines a standard primary sort like "lead conversion rate (descending)" or "number of leads (descending)" for an RM list.\n  - Where analogous lists exist (customers), the default user‑triggered sort is by **name, ascending or descending**; for activities, by **status or date**.   \n  - It is therefore reasonable to infer that, **unless your implementation has a custom BRD**, an RM list on such a view would typically default to either:\n    - Alphabetical by RM name, or\n    - A simple metric such as total leads or AUM, if configured locally.\n  - However, **this is not codified in the shared documents**, so any concrete metric‑based ordering must come from project‑specific configuration, not the generic standard.\n\n- **Tie‑break logic (e.g., conversion rate, pipeline value, recency):**\n  - No tie‑breaker hierarchy is specified anywhere for a list of RMs (e.g., "if conversion rate is equal, then sort by total pipeline, then by name").\n\n- **Configurability of sorting (user vs admin):**\n  - Related widgets (customers, To‑Dos, notes) allow the **end user to pick the sort criterion** (e.g., status vs date, ascending vs descending, by name).   \n  - There is **no explicit configuration section** describing admin‑level controls to define or lock the default RM ranking logic for lead performance.\n\n- **Influence of filters (region, time window, etc.):**\n  - Filters on dashboards (HNW, AUM, product type, RM/Agent name) clearly **constrain which customers or records are displayed**, but do **not alter the underlying sort rule**; sort and filter are independent actions in the described screens.  \n  - By analogy, regional or time‑window filters on an RM lead‑performance view would typically **change the dataset (which RMs or which leads are counted)**, while the ranking rule (whatever is configured) remains the same.\n\n- **Data sources for any RM performance ranking:**\n  - The broader ecosystem uses **leads, opportunities, activities, and customer holdings** as sources for RM‑level metrics (e.g., opportunities from call reports, alerts, AUM and product composition on dashboards).  \n  - However, the documents stop short of stating a specific formula for a composite "lead performance" score or its direct use in sorting RMs.\n\n### 4. Practical conclusion\nGiven the current documentation set:\n\n- **There is no standard, documented system logic that definitively states how RMs are sorted in a dedicated “lead‑performance” RM list (no fixed primary metric, direction, or tie‑breakers).**\n- Existing patterns show:\n  - **Simple, single‑field sorts** (mostly by name, date, or status), chosen by the user in each widget.   \n  - **Filters** that affect what records appear, but not the sort mechanism itself.\n- Therefore, if your environment shows a ranked list of RMs by lead performance, the ordering is most likely **defined in a project‑specific BRD or configuration (e.g., custom KPI weighting or supervisor‑view logic)** rather than in the base product specification.\n\nFor an accurate answer in your specific instance, you would need to refer to your implementation’s BRD/FRD or configuration notes that define:\n- Which KPI (or composite score) is used as the primary sort, and\n- Any secondary metrics or name‑based tie‑break rules applied on that screen.\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n[1] JioBlackRock_Journey of Self Assessment and Supervisor Assessment - RM Dashboard_V10_CCV10.pdf  \n[2] SAAB-Journey of Self_Assessment and Supervisor Assessment_Customer Dashboard_V13_CCV10docx.pdf  \n[3] Maybank_Journey of Self-Assessment and Supervisor Assessment-Customer Dashboard_V12_CCV_V10docx.pdf', 'd91b121e-5ac3-40dd-897b-23e557cf2ff5', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":["RM","Lead","Relationship","Portfolio Performance Report","Customer Dashboard","Risk Profile Deviation alert"],"seed_node_ids":["report:customer_dashboard","dataentity:relationship","report:pf_performance_report","system:rmws","report:risk_profile_deviation_alert","dataentity:lead","dataentity:rm"],"expanded_nodes":39,"expanded_edges":1180,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: d91b121e-5ac3-40dd-897b-23e557cf2ff5\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('253', '92', 'assistant', '# Risk profiling in the system: end-to-end view ## 1. Overview - Risk profiling is a configurable, questionnaire-driven mechanism used to determine a customer’s risk appetite and assign a risk profile based on questionnaire scores. Every customer has a risk appetite, and the application decides the risk profile by aggregating the questionnaire results. This configuration of risk profiling and risk appetite is explicitly described in the risk framework documents. [1] ## 2. Data inputs - Core inputs include customer data, risk questionnaires, and risk appetite mappings used to establish how responses map to a risk profile. Risk appetite mapping resources (grid/mappings) are used to align questionnaire scores with corresponding risk levels. [5] - The risk questionnaire itself contains fields and structure used to collect customer responses (question descriptions, mandatory flags, multi-select options, scoring types, computation types, and score ranges). [2] - Question definitions and scoring rules (e.g., None vs Range scoring, Sum computation, and range-based scoring) are standard across implementations. [7] ## 3. Questionnaire configuration and flow - Users can create and configure risk profile questionnaires within the application, including setting up questions, mandatory flags, multi-select options, scoring types, and calculation logic. Screen: Create a new risk profile questionnaire. [1] - Each question supports various attributes such as Mandatory Type, Multi Select, Scoring Type (None/Range), Computation Type (Sum), and from/to score ranges with an associated final Score. [2] - The risk questionnaire structure supports additional elements like warnings, acknowledgements, and disclaimers to be presented during profiling. [2] ## 4. Scoring rules and mapping - Scoring can be configured per question as None or Range, with a Sum computation for aggregating responses across questions. Range-type scoring maps specific response ranges to a final score. [7] - The aggregated scores from the questionnaire feed into a risk appetite/risk profile mapping to produce a final risk rating for the customer. This linkage between questionnaire scores and risk appetite is described in risk profiling configurations. [1] ## 5. Validations and governance - The system enforces governance checks during profiling and transaction processing, including general validations and KYC-related validations (e.g., mandatory fields, length checks, and KYC status gating). [4] - There are risk-profile-specific validations in order-flow scenarios, such as ensuring a risk profile exists and is current; otherwise, certain actions (purchase, switch, SIP) may be disallowed. If the risk profile is expired, related actions are blocked; if no risk profile is present, actions are blocked. [3] ## 6. Storage and ownership of risk data - Risk profiles are surfaced and managed within the customer and RM dashboards, reflecting risk-based grouping and visibility (e.g., customers grouped by risk profile, tracked by AUM). This governance/monitoring is shown in RM dashboards and customer dashboards. [13] - Risk appetite mappings and questionnaire configurations are stored as part of the risk framework, enabling mapping between questionnaire results and risk brackets. [5] ## 7. System modules and screens involved - The risk profiling configuration and execution involve modules such as the risk questionnaire designer (screen for creating risk profile questionnaires) and the PMS/Intellect integration points used to read/write risk-related data during transactions. Screens and flows for risk questionnaires are described in risk profiling journey documents. [1] - The risk profile framework is implemented across multiple platforms (e.g., Intellect, HSBC PWS), with cross-system orchestration to enforce risk constraints during order placement and portfolio actions. [2] ## 8. How the risk profile drives portfolio decisions and approvals - Product risk checks are performed against customer risk; if product risk exceeds customer risk, a notification is generated to alert the user. This gating ensures alignment between customer risk capacity and product selections. [3] - If a risk profile is expired, or if a customer does not have a risk profile, certain actions (Purchase/Switch/SIP) are disallowed, enforcing governance over portfolio changes. [3] - Risk-profile data also informs RM dashboards and customer composition analyses, enabling awareness and governance by risk tier when reviewing portfolios. [16] ## 9. In practice: a high-level flow - Create/configure a risk profile questionnaire (questions, scoring rules, mandatory fields). [1] - Collect customer responses and compute a risk score (sum or range-based computation). [7] - Map the score to a risk appetite/risk profile using predefined risk appetite mappings.

('261', '97', 'assistant', '# Risk profiling in the system: end-to-end view ## 1. Overview - Risk profiling is a configurable, questionnaire-driven mechanism used to determine a customer’s risk appetite and assign a risk profile based on questionnaire scores. Every customer has a risk appetite, and the application decides the risk profile by aggregating the questionnaire results. This configuration of risk profiling and risk appetite is explicitly described in the risk framework documents. [1] ## 2. Data inputs - Core inputs include customer data, risk questionnaires, and risk appetite mappings used to establish how responses map to a risk profile. Risk appetite mapping resources (grid/mappings) are used to align questionnaire scores with corresponding risk levels. [5] - The risk questionnaire itself contains fields and structure used to collect customer responses (question descriptions, mandatory flags, multi-select options, scoring types, computation types, and score ranges). [2] - Question definitions and scoring rules (e.g., None vs Range scoring, Sum computation, and range-based scoring) are standard across implementations. [7] ## 3. Questionnaire configuration and flow - Users can create and configure risk profile questionnaires within the application, including setting up questions, mandatory flags, multi-select options, scoring types, and calculation logic. Screen: Create a new risk profile questionnaire. [1] - Each question supports various attributes such as Mandatory Type, Multi Select, Scoring Type (None/Range), Computation Type (Sum), and from/to score ranges with an associated final Score. [2] - The risk questionnaire structure supports additional elements like warnings, acknowledgements, and disclaimers to be presented during profiling. [2] ## 4. Scoring rules and mapping - Scoring can be configured per question as None or Range, with a Sum computation for aggregating responses across questions. Range-type scoring maps specific response ranges to a final score. [7] - The aggregated scores from the questionnaire feed into a risk appetite/risk profile mapping to produce a final risk rating for the customer. This linkage between questionnaire scores and risk appetite is described in risk profiling configurations. [1] ## 5. Validations and governance - The system enforces governance checks during profiling and transaction processing, including general validations and KYC-related validations (e.g., mandatory fields, length checks, and KYC status gating). [4] - There are risk-profile-specific validations in order-flow scenarios, such as ensuring a risk profile exists and is current; otherwise, certain actions (purchase, switch, SIP) may be disallowed. If the risk profile is expired, related actions are blocked; if no risk profile is present, actions are blocked. [3] ## 6. Storage and ownership of risk data - Risk profiles are surfaced and managed within the customer and RM dashboards, reflecting risk-based grouping and visibility (e.g., customers grouped by risk profile, tracked by AUM). This governance/monitoring is shown in RM dashboards and customer dashboards. [13] - Risk appetite mappings and questionnaire configurations are stored as part of the risk framework, enabling mapping between questionnaire results and risk brackets. [5] ## 7. System modules and screens involved - The risk profiling configuration and execution involve modules such as the risk questionnaire designer (screen for creating risk profile questionnaires) and the PMS/Intellect integration points used to read/write risk-related data during transactions. Screens and flows for risk questionnaires are described in risk profiling journey documents. [1] - The risk profile framework is implemented across multiple platforms (e.g., Intellect, HSBC PWS), with cross-system orchestration to enforce risk constraints during order placement and portfolio actions. [2] ## 8. How the risk profile drives portfolio decisions and approvals - Product risk checks are performed against customer risk; if product risk exceeds customer risk, a notification is generated to alert the user. This gating ensures alignment between customer risk capacity and product selections. [3] - If a risk profile is expired, or if a customer does not have a risk profile, certain actions (Purchase/Switch/SIP) are disallowed, enforcing governance over portfolio changes. [3] - Risk-profile data also informs RM dashboards and customer composition analyses, enabling awareness and governance by risk tier when reviewing portfolios. [16] ## 9. In practice: a high-level flow - Create/configure a risk profile questionnaire (questions, scoring rules, mandatory fields). [1] - Collect customer responses and compute a risk score (sum or range-based computation). [7] - Map the score to a risk appetite/risk profile using predefined risk appetite mappings. [5] - Enforce governance: ensure KYC status is valid, and prevent actions if risk profile is missing or expired. [4] - Reflect and monitor the result in dashboards (customer RM views, risk-profile-based grouping).

('204', '81', 'assistant', '## Bank account validation during onboarding\n\n1) Validation step used\n- The onboarding flow employs a penny-drop (micro-deposit) verification to confirm the customer’s bank account details and ownership. The system indicates successful verification and proceeds once the account is validated. This verification is triggered during the bank details entry step in the onboarding flow and is followed by progression to subsequent steps once verification succeeds [1].\n\n2) How the verification is performed\n- The customer enters bank details (bank name, account number, etc.) and initiates a verification action (often labeled as sending a nominal amount, e.g., a penny cheque or ₹1). The platform validates this micro-deposit; upon successful verification, the user sees a Verified Bank Accounts screen and can continue with onboarding [1].\n\n3) Verification providers and scope\n- The documented flows describe in-app penny-drop verification as part of the onboarding process, without explicit reference to an external verification provider. The verification is embedded within the onboarding platform’s bank details workflow and aligns with the broader identity/KYC steps [1].\n\n4) Regulatory and KYC considerations\n- Bank account validation is integrated into the broader KYC-enabled onboarding flow. The process is linked to regulatory/compliance requirements around validating funding sources and ownership, with the onboarding sequence explicitly leading to KYC completion after bank verification (e.g., a screen or steps titled “Details Required to Finish KYC”) [1].\n\n\nSources\n\n[1] HSBC_DIY_Journey of Customer Onboarding V10.pdf\n[2] HSBC_DIY_Journey of Customer Onboarding V10.pdf', '9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Bank Details","payment details","Funding Account","Identity","KYC Compliance information","KYC UPDATION OVERDUE IN ACCOUNT","Bank comments","Common RTA Feed file","Transferee Details","Joint Accounts"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:common_rta_feed_file","dataentity:bank_details","dataentity:joint_accounts","dataentity:identity","dataentity:transferee_details","compliance:kyc_compliance_info","dataentity:payment_details","datastore:funding_account","dataentity:funding_account","dataentity:bank_comments","compliance:kyc_updation_overdue_account"],"expanded_nodes":16,"expanded_edges":423,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: 9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('168', '72', 'assistant', '## RM Performance Analytics on the Wealth Platform\n\n### What analytics exist\n- RM Dashboard provides a holistic, single-view interface for Relationship Managers to monitor the performance and activity of their mapped customers. It aggregates business-relevant information and supports quick consumption, with interactive widgets and drill-down capabilities. The dashboard is designed to help RMs grow revenue and manage their book efficiently [1].\n- Benchmarking analytics exist to compare RM performance against peers, enabling relative performance assessment (peer-to-peer benchmarking). The RM can view peer benchmarks and hover to see performance details, including median values and top performers in the zone [3].\n- Specific widgets and metrics frequently surfaced in RM dashboards include: Asset Under Management (AUM), Revenue Under Management (RUM), Customer Composition, Gain/Loss by Number of Customers, Opportunity Summary, and Prospects To Clients. These elements are shown as dashboard widgets with drill-down paths to further detail (L2/L3 views) [1].\n- Additional analytics focus areas include opportunities by product type and sub-product type, AUM by currency, and revenue by product category, each supporting deeper drilling into the data (L2/L3 views) [5], [4].\n- Risk-management analytics appear as alerting mechanisms linked to risk profile events (e.g., risk profile expiry/change, risk-related product vs customer risk checks) and are part of the broader maintenance/alert framework described in governance materials [6].\n\n### KPIs and dashboards (examples)\n- Asset Under Management (AUM): RM dashboard widgets display AUM by customer and by currency in various views [1], [5].\n- Revenue Under Management (RUM): Monthly, by product category (e.g., MF, fixed income, PMS, etc.), for the current year, as captured in RUM widgets [4].\n- Customer Composition: Breakdown by risk profile and by sub-product type, with drill-down options to see customer-level details [1], [13].\n- Gain/Loss by Number of Customers: A metric showing wealth gain/loss across the RM’s customer base, with per-metric drill-downs [3].\n- Opportunity Summary and Prospects-to-Clients: Pipeline-like views showing potential conversions and client conversion flow [4].\n- Peer Benchmarking: Relative performance against peers with hover-enabled details for metrics such as AUM and engagement indicators [3].\n- Sub-Product and Currency Views: Opportunity by Sub Product Type and AUM by Currency, enabling RM to target gaps and currency-specific holdings [5].\n- Risk-Profile Based Alerts: Alerts around risk-profile expiry, changes, and product-versus-customer risk gaps, as part of risk governance and RM supervision [6].\n\n### Data sources commonly referenced by analytics\n- Asset and portfolio data: AUM, investment holdings, and per-product revenue signals (e.g., MF, PMS, fixed income). Widgets explicitly show AUM, revenue by category, and product-level opportunities [1], [4], [5].\n- Customer-level attributes and risk data: Customer risk profiles and risk-profile-based compositions are surfaced in dashboard widgets for composition analyses [1], [5].\n- Interaction/pipeline data: Prospects to clients and opportunity summaries reflect engagement and conversion metrics derived from customer interactions and product opportunities [4].\n\n### Time horizons (typical granularity)\n- Revenue Under Management is presented month-by-month for the current year as a primary time dimension in the RM dashboard [4].\n- Other dashboards support multi-period drill-down (L2/L3 layers) to explore historical or current-period data depending on the widget, with hover or detail views that reveal time-bucket breakdowns where available [1], [3], [5].\n\n### Access roles and consumption\n- The RM dashboard and its components are RM-facing, providing a personal, mapped-customer view and peer benchmarks (e.g., My Space and RM Dashboard concepts appear as RM-centric interfaces in governance documents) [2].\n- The governance materials describe an alert-driven, supervisor-enabled framework that feeds risk-related deviations and ensures oversight, indicating role-based visibility for managers and risk/compliance reviewers in practice [6].\n\n### Export formats and configurability\n- Export formats (CSV, PDF) are not explicitly documented in the captured materials; the primary emphasis is on interactive dashboards with drill-down and hover-based detail, suggesting interactive consumption rather than fixed exports in the described sources [1], [4], [5].\n- Metrics show configurability in practice via interactive UI elements (drill-downs to L2/L3, hover details, and dynamic dashboards) and via alert-rule governance (risk-profile alerts and product-vs-risk checks), indicating at least some degree of configurability for what is measured and when alerts trigger [1], [3], [6].\n\n### Example governance and maintenance context (relevant to RM analytics)\n- Maintenance and alerting rules cover risk-profile expiry/change, product risk vs. customer risk alignment, and other RM-related alerts, illustrating how analytics are governed and what events can drive RM-focused reporting [6].\n\n### References (documents)\n- JioBlackRock_Journey of Self Assessment and Supervisor Assessment - RM Dashboard_V10_CCV10.pdf [1]\n- HSBC_Journey of Self Assessment and Supervisor Assessment - RM Dashboard_V10_CCV10.pdf [2]\n- JioBlackRock_Journey of Self Assessment and Supervisor Assessment - RM Dashboard_V10_CCV10.pdf [3]\n- JioBlackRock_Journey of Self Assessment and Supervisor Assessment - RM Dashboard_V10_CCV10.pdf [4]\n- HSBC_Journey of Self Assessment and Supervisor Assessment - RM Dashboard_V10_CCV10.pdf [5]\n- WQ_Journey of Defining Maintenances_HSBC_V10_CCV10.pdf [6]\n\nSources\n- JioBlackRock_Journey of Self Assessment and Supervisor Assessment - RM Dashboard_V10_CCV10.pdf\n- HSBC_Journey of Self Assessment and Supervisor Assessment - RM Dashboard_V10_CCV10.pdf\n- IIFL_Journey of Self-Assessment and Supervisor Assessment-RM Dashboard_CCV13.pdf\n- WQ_Journey of Defining Maintenances_HSBC_V10_CCV10.pdf\n- SBI_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement-G26-G32-G35-Product Selection.pdf\n- SAAB-Journey of Self_Assessment and Supervisor Assessment_RM Dashboard_V10_CCV10docx.pdf', 'b337f6c9-821c-49f7-98d4-8ea6f4b6e3ce', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Portfolio Performance Report","RM","MIS Report","Customer Dashboard","Risk Profile Deviation alert","Annexure","View Performance Graph","Order Book Report","Risk Profile Questionnaire","Product Cart"],"seed_node_ids":["report:mis_report","datastore:product_cart","report:risk_profile_deviation_alert","system:product_cart","dataentity:risk_profile_questionnaire","report:product_cart","report:risk_profile_questionnaire","dataentity:annexure","report:pf_performance_report","system:rmws","report:view_performance_graph","report:annexure","report:order_book_report","dataentity:rm","report:customer_dashboard","dataentity:product_cart"],"expanded_nodes":63,"expanded_edges":74,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What kind of analytics is available to evalute RM''s performance?","What analytics exist to evaluate the performance of Relationship Managers (RMs) in the wealth management platform?","Identify the analytics, KPIs, dashboards, and reports the platform provides to evaluate RM performance, including data sources (CRM, client activity, assets under management, revenue attribution), time horizons (monthly, quarterly, rolling periods), access roles (manager, compliance), export formats (CSV, PDF), and whether metrics are configurable.","[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What kind of analytics is available to evalute RM''s performance?

('185', '78', 'user', 'How can a user track the progress of active campaigns and record specific feedback from customers?', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-12-16 05:42:09.834818'),
('213', '82', 'user', 'What actions can a user perform to test campaign communications before they are broadcasted to customers?', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-12-16 07:19:34.777892'),
('214', '82', 'assistant', '## Overview\n\nBefore campaign communications are broadcasted to customers, users typically have a set of **testing, validation and approval capabilities**. These are designed to ensure the right content goes to the right audience in the right format, and that all activities are auditable.\n\nBelow is a consolidated, platform‑agnostic view of such capabilities.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Previewing Campaign Communications\n\nUsers can generate and view previews of campaign messages before sending:\n\n- **Channel‑specific previews** – For each selected channel (Email, SMS, etc.), the user can open a preview screen to see the exact subject, body, and layout that will be sent. Campaign communication screens already distinguish and allow separate handling of Email and SMS broadcasts  .\n- **Multi‑device / multi‑client rendering checks** – For emails, users can view how the message renders in desktop vs mobile layouts. For SMS/push, they can verify character counts, truncation, and link formatting.\n- **Audience‑context preview** – Users can preview how the message will appear for a sample customer (e.g., using a test profile) to verify personalization fields.\n\n**Expected outcome:** The user confirms that content, layout, and basic formatting are correct for each channel and target device before any live send.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Test Sends to Internal Recipients\n\nUsers can perform controlled test sends before a full broadcast:\n\n- **Send to internal email addresses** – From the campaign communication screen, the user can initiate an email send to designated internal test mailboxes, similar to how they trigger regular Email communication via a dedicated "Send Mail" action .\n- **Send to internal test mobile numbers** – For SMS campaigns, users can send test messages to internal or test mobile numbers using the same Send SMS function used for live broadcasts, but restricted to a test audience .\n- **Test push/in‑app notifications** – For push or in‑app messages, a limited test group (e.g., internal users or test devices) can be configured to receive trial notifications.\n\n**Expected outcome:** The team validates deliverability, subject lines, links, and visual behavior in real clients before including actual customers.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Validation of Personalization and Dynamic Fields\n\nCampaigns often contain personalized tokens and dynamic content (e.g., customer name, portfolio metrics). Before broadcasting, the system supports validation such as:\n\n- **Placeholder resolution checks** – In preview or test sends, the system resolves personalization tokens (e.g., customer name, RM name, product details) against sample records to ensure they render correctly and do not show raw placeholders.\n- **Data availability checks** – If a required data point for personalization is missing for a customer, validations or warnings are raised, analogous to general and field‑level validations used in other journeys .\n\n**Expected outcome:** Messages display complete, correct personalized information; missing data is identified and handled (fallback text or exclusion) before live broadcast.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Content and Compliance Validations\n\nBefore a campaign is allowed to move to broadcast, the platform typically runs a set of validations similar to those used in transaction journeys:\n\n- **Mandatory fields validation** – Ensures that mandatory fields such as subject, body text, channel selection, and target audience are populated, analogous to mandatory field checks in order placement .\n- **Format and content rules** – Validates that key fields conform to format rules (e.g., no prohibited special characters in subject lines, valid URLs, character limits for SMS).\n- **Compliance checks** – Verifies that opt‑in/consent flags are respected and that communications are aligned with customer contact preferences, similar in spirit to general validations and actor/entitlement controls defined for other journeys .\n\n**Expected outcome:** The system blocks or warns on non‑compliant or incomplete campaigns, forcing corrections before approval or broadcast.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Multi‑Channel Formatting and Consistency Checks\n\nFor campaigns sent across multiple channels (Email + SMS + push):\n\n- **Channel‑specific templates** – Users verify that each channel’s template is appropriately tailored (e.g., shortened SMS content vs richer email content), using the separate send actions for Email and SMS on the campaign communication screen .\n- **Cross‑channel consistency** – Users confirm that core message, key disclosures, and call‑to‑action are consistent across channels, even if format differs.\n\n**Expected outcome:** Each channel presents a fit‑for‑purpose version of the message, while keeping the underlying intent and disclosures consistent.\n\n---\n\n## 6. A/B Testing and Variant Comparison (Where Enabled)\n\nSome platforms support A/B or multivariate testing before full roll‑out:\n\n- **Variant creation** – Users create multiple content variants (different subject lines, layouts, or call‑to‑action).\n- **Test group selection** – A small portion of the target audience or an internal test group is assigned to each variant.\n- **Performance comparison** – Based on open/click/response metrics (for the test window), the best‑performing variant is selected for the main broadcast.\n\n**Expected outcome:** Campaigns are optimized based on measured performance before large‑scale send.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Staging / Test Environment Usage\n\nTo further minimize risk, users can:\n\n- **Configure and run campaigns in a non‑production (staging) environment** – Mirroring production data structures but with masked or synthetic data.\n- **Dry‑run workflows** – Execute the full lifecycle (design → preview → test send → approval) without any real customer impact.\n\n**Expected outcome:** Complex or high‑impact campaigns are validated end‑to‑end in a safe environment before being recreated or promoted to production.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Approval and "To Approve" Workflows\n\nSimilar to transaction journeys where orders created by one user must be approved by a supervisor via a **To Approve** tab and order card details , campaigns typically leverage parallel approval patterns:\n\n- **Draft vs. Ready‑for‑Approval states** – Users prepare and validate the campaign (content, audience, tests) and then mark it as ready for approval.\n- **Supervisor / QA review queue** – Approvers access a dedicated "To Approve" or equivalent tab, where pending campaigns appear much like pending orders. They can expand each item to review content, audience, and validation results before approving or rejecting .\n- **Entitlement‑based access** – Only users with the required approval entitlement can authorize broadcasts, aligning with the actor/entitlement framework used in other journeys .\n\n**Expected outcome:** No campaign is broadcasted without explicit approval from an authorized user; the process is controlled and governed.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Broadcast Status, Outcomes, and Logging\n\nOnce campaigns are tested and approved, the system tracks and exposes status and logs:\n\n- **Broadcast status tracking** – The campaign communication screen displays the broadcast status of Email and SMS communications, allowing users to confirm whether a send is pending, in progress, completed, or failed  .\n- **Activity and audit logs** – Key actions—such as content changes, test sends, approval decisions, and final broadcasts—are logged with timestamps and user identifiers, following the same auditability principles as order and approval journeys .\n- **Error handling and retry** – If any part of the broadcast fails (e.g., channel gateway issues), the system captures errors and may trigger retry mechanisms or alerts to users.\n\n**Expected outcome:** Users have clear visibility into what was sent, to whom, when, and by whom, with an audit trail supporting internal and regulatory reviews.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Summary of User Actions Before Broadcast\n\nIn practical terms, a user can typically perform the following actions before sending campaign communications to customers:\n\n1. Design or upload content for each channel.\n2. Preview the message per channel and device.\n3. Validate personalization and dynamic fields using sample profiles.\n4. Run automated validations for mandatory fields, formats, and compliance.\n5. Send test messages to internal email addresses and test mobile numbers.\n6. (Optionally) Run A/B tests on content variants with a limited audience.\n7. Execute end‑to‑end dry runs in a staging/test environment.\n8. Submit the campaign into an approval workflow.\n9.

('216', '82', 'assistant', '## 1. Overview\n\nUsers should be able to:\n\n- View each active campaign’s status, progress vs. targets, and key KPIs on a campaign dashboard, using charts such as pie charts and deviation views already familiar from deviation & exposure widgets for portfolios and securities  .\n- Drill into a specific campaign to see milestones, underlying securities or products being promoted, and client-level engagement.\n- Log structured customer feedback (ratings, comments, sentiment, and channel) that is linked to both the campaign and the client account.\n- Use soft-stop style validations and alerts (similar to the list of soft stop deviations in order journeys) to ensure mandatory feedback fields and key compliance checks are met before saving or closing items  .\n\nThe design can reuse familiar patterns from the wealth order journey: dashboards for status (similar to Order Book), deviation/exposure visualizations, and soft/hard stop deviations for rule enforcement  .\n\n---\n\n## 2. Data Model\n\n### 2.1 Campaign\nKey fields:\n- **CampaignId** (identifier)\n- **Name**\n- **Description**\n- **Objective / KPI definitions** (e.g., target AUM, number of leads, conversion rate)\n- **StartDate, EndDate**\n- **Status** (Planned, Active, On Hold, Completed, Cancelled)\n- **TargetSegments** (e.g., HNI segment, specific risk profiles)\n- **RelatedSecurities / Products** – link to security master or scheme master so KPIs can use existing holdings, asset class, and sector data used for deviation & exposure views  .\n- **OwnerRM / Team**\n- **Budget & Spend-to-date** (optional)\n\n### 2.2 CampaignProgress\nCaptures time-series progress and milestones:\n- **CampaignProgressId**\n- **CampaignId (FK)**\n- **AsOfDate**\n- **StatusSnapshot** (e.g., % complete, phase)\n- **KPI values** (e.g., number of contacts, meetings, proposals, orders placed, AUM influenced)\n- **DeviationFromTarget%** – analogous to portfolio deviation (actual vs. model vs. selected) used in deviation graphs ; here, compare *actual KPIs vs. target KPIs*.\n- **Milestone** (e.g., “Launched email blast”, “Completed RM meetings for Tier-1 clients”)\n\n### 2.3 CustomerFeedback\nFeedback at client and interaction level:\n- **FeedbackId**\n- **CampaignId (FK)**\n- **ClientId / InvestorId (FK)**\n- **InteractionDate**\n- **Channel** (Phone, In-person, Email, Portal, RM App, Event, etc.)\n- **Rating** (e.g., 1–5 or sentiment buckets: Positive/Neutral/Negative)\n- **SentimentScore** (derived or manually tagged)\n- **FeedbackComments**\n- **ProductsDiscussed / Securities** – linked to relevant securities or schemes if the feedback is about specific products, reusing security-level attributes like asset class and sector already used in exposure views  .\n- **NextAction** (Follow-up call, send proposal, do nothing, etc.)\n- **ActionOwner** (RM, Service team)\n- **Status** (Open, In Progress, Closed)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key Screens and UX\n\n### 3.1 Campaign Dashboard\n\nPurpose: High-level monitoring of all active campaigns.\n\nCore elements:\n- **Campaign list / grid** showing:\n  - Campaign name, owner, segment\n  - Status and start/end dates\n  - High-level KPIs: e.g., #clients contacted, #orders, AUM influenced\n  - Visual indicator (e.g., traffic light or progress bar) for on-track / off-track based on deviation from targets.\n- **Aggregated charts**:\n  - **Pie chart** for distribution of active campaigns by segment, product type, or status.\n  - **Deviation-style chart** comparing *target vs. actual KPIs* across campaigns, reusing the concept of “model vs. actual vs. selected” from asset allocation graphs .\n- **Filters** by segment, RM, product, date range, and status.\n\nThink of this as the campaign-level equivalent of an Order Book, which lists all orders with their status against each order .\n\n### 3.2 Campaign Details Screen\n\nPurpose: Detailed view of a single campaign.\n\nSections:\n1. **Header** – Campaign summary (name, dates, owner, status, primary KPIs).\n2. **Progress & Deviation Widget**\n   - A **deviation graph** showing **target vs. actual vs. latest forecast** for core KPIs (e.g., “clients contacted”, “orders placed”, “AUM booked”), mirroring the model vs. actual vs. selected exposure widgets used for portfolios  .\n   - A **pie chart** for breakdown of responses by sentiment (positive/neutral/negative) or by product/security.\n3. **Milestone Timeline** – List of milestones from CampaignProgress.\n4. **Linked Orders / Transactions** – Show orders tagged as campaign-influenced, reusing the pattern from transaction and order displays where transaction date, number, and status are visible  .\n5. **Customer Feedback Tab** – Grid of feedback records with ability to filter by sentiment, RM, channel, etc.\n\n### 3.3 Feedback Capture Screen\n\nPurpose: Enable RMs or operations staff to log structured feedback after an interaction.\n\nAccess paths:\n- From **Campaign Details** (e.g., “Log Feedback” button).\n- From **Client / Investor 360** (select campaign + log feedback).\n\nFields:\n- Campaign (pre-selected when navigating from campaign)\n- Client / Account\n- Interaction date & time\n- Channel (LOV)\n- Rating & sentiment\n- Comment / notes\n- Products / securities discussed (multi-select linked to security master)\n- Next action & owner\n- Attachments (optional, e.g., meeting notes PDF)\n\nValidations:\n- Mandatory-field validation similar to order forms where mandatory fields marked with * must be filled before save .\n- **Soft-stop deviations** if key business rules are breached (e.g., missing sentiment for negative comments, missing next action for low rating), using the same concept as the *list of soft stop deviations* exposed in product cart overlays  .\n- **Hard-stop deviations** if minimal compliance requirements are not met (e.g., no client selected), blocking save until resolved, similar to existing hard-stop deviations on orders.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Core Workflows\n\n### 4.1 Create Campaign\n1. User navigates to Campaign Dashboard and selects **Create Campaign**.\n2. Enters campaign details (name, dates, segments, KPIs, target values, owner, budget).\n3. Selects related products/securities, drawing from security/scheme masters already used in product selection and exposure views  .\n4. System performs validations (dates, mandatory fields; optional soft stops for missing KPIs or segment definition).\n5. On success, campaign is created with status **Planned** or **Active**.\n\n### 4.2 Update Progress\n1. At defined intervals (daily/weekly), user or batch process creates **CampaignProgress** entries.\n2. KPIs are updated by:\n   - Auto-aggregating linked interactions (meetings, calls, portal logins) and orders tagged with the campaign; orders are already trackable with status at order level similar to Order Book views .\n   - Manual adjustments (e.g., event attendance count).\n3. The deviation widget recalculates **target vs. actual vs. forecast**, mirroring allocation deviation behavior.\n\n### 4.3 Log Feedback\n1. From either a client record or campaign, user selects **Log Feedback**.\n2. Feedback Capture screen opens with pre-filled campaign and optionally client.\n3. User fills mandatory fields; system raises soft-stop warnings if recommended data (e.g., sentiment) is missing.\n4. On save, feedback is:\n   - Linked to the campaign and client.\n   - Included in campaign sentiment charts and KPI calculations.\n\n### 4.4 Approve / Close Campaign\n1. When end date or KPI thresholds are reached, campaign moves to **Ready to Close**.\n2. Reviewer assesses KPIs, deviation from targets, and feedback summary.\n3. Reviewer approves closure; campaign status updated to **Completed**.\n4. System freezes further structural changes but still allows post-campaign reporting.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Validation Rules and Soft/Hard Stops\n\nReusing patterns from order journeys where product cart overlays highlight hard-stop and soft-stop deviations for an order  :\n\n- **Hard Stops (block action)**:\n  - Create Campaign: missing mandatory fields (name, dates, owner, at least one KPI).\n  - Log Feedback: missing client, campaign, basic comment or rating.\n- **Soft Stops (allow override with warning)**:\n  - Campaign without defined target KPIs.\n  - Feedback with low rating but no next action defined.\n\nThe UI can present these as a **“list of hard stop deviations”** and **“list of soft stop deviations”** in a deviations panel, parallel to existing order deviation patterns.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Reporting and Analytics\n\n### 6.1 Campaign Performance Reports\n\n- **Campaign Summary report**: status, duration, target vs. actual KPIs, deviation %, linked orders/AUM.\n- **Segment & Product performance**: break down by client segment and by security/asset class using existing asset-class and sector categorization logic already used in exposure widgets  .\n\n### 6.2 Feedback Trend Reports\n\n- **Sentiment over time** per campaign.\n- **Channel effectiveness**: KPIs by interaction channel.\n- **RM performance**: feedback ratings by RM or team.\n\nVisuals:\n- Pie charts for sentiment distribution, channel mix, and positive/negative feedback ratio.\n- Line or bar charts for KPI progression vs. targets.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Integration, Security, and Audit\n\n### 7.1 Integration Touchpoints\n\n- **CRM / Marketing tools**:\n  - Import campaign definitions and target client lists.\n  - Sync interaction events (emails sent, opens, clicks, event attendance).\n- **Order and portfolio systems**:\n  - Tag orders as campaign-influenced.\n  - Use existing security and scheme masters for product associations and asset/sector breakdowns, similar to the deviation & exposure and security holdings views  fileciteturn0file18.\n\n### 7.2 Security Roles\n\n- **Campaign Owner / RM** – create and update campaigns they own; log and edit feedback for their clients.\n- **Operations / Marketing Admin** – manage master data, approve/close campaigns.\n- **View-only roles** – view dashboards and reports but cannot modify campaigns or feedback.\n\n### 7.3 Audit Considerations\n\n- Maintain **audit trails** for:\n  - Campaign creation, modification, and closure (who, what, when).\n  - Feedback creation and edits.\n  - Changes to KPI targets and thresholds.\n- Log overrides where users proceed despite soft-stop warnings, similar to how soft-stop deviations may be overridden in order flows.\n\n---\n\n## 8. How Users Track Progress and Capture Feedback in Practice\n\n1. **Daily/Weekly Monitoring**\n   - User opens the Campaign Dashboard to see all active campaigns, their status, and high-level KPIs with deviation indicators and charts.\n2. **Drill-Down**\n   - For a specific campaign, user opens Campaign Details to check detailed KPI progress, deviation graphs, milestone history, orders, and feedback distribution.\n3. **Field-Level Feedback Capture**\n   - After each client interaction, RM logs feedback via the Feedback Capture screen, ensuring mandatory fields are filled and resolving or accepting any soft-stop warnings.\n4. **Closing the Loop**\n   - At the end of the campaign, the owner and approver review performance and feedback trends before closing, with all key actions and deviations audited.\n\nThis design lets users manage campaigns end-to-end while reusing proven UX and validation patterns from existing wealth order, deviation, and exposure journeys.\n\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] 360ONE_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V11_CCV13_Part 1.pdf  \n[2] SBI_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V10_SBI_CCV13.pdf  \n[3] SBI_Journey of Client Portal_Order Placement_V10_CCV11.pdf  \n[4] HSBC_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V11_CCV10_Part 1.pdf  \n[5] 360ONE_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V11_CCV13_Part 3.pdf', 'd76a1db5-04aa-4e7c-b146-e1132c549c20', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":["RM","Order","customer","transaction","Product risk profile","Mutual Funds","Field Level Details","Portfolio Performance Report","pie chart","Minimum Amount/Unit Validation"],"seed_node_ids":["report:pf_performance_report","system:rmws","dataentity:field_level_details","report:pie_chart","dataentity:product_risk_profile","dataentity:mutual_funds","dataentity:rm","dataentity:transaction","dataentity:order","dataentity:customer","report:minimum_amount_unit_validation","report:field_level_details"],"expanded_nodes":63,"expanded_edges":128,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: d76a1db5-04aa-4e7c-b146-e1132c549c20\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('218', '82', 'assistant', '## Primary Functional Difference\n\n**Handover** and **Delegation** serve different purposes in managing customer and prospect relationships:\n\n- **Handover = Permanent transfer of relationship ownership**\n- **Delegation = Temporary assignment of relationship management**\n\n### 1. Ownership and Control\n\n- **Handover**\n  - Transfers the *primary ownership* of the selected Leads/Prospects/Customers from one agent/RM to another. The receiving agent becomes the new ongoing owner for those relationships.\n  - Used when a new agent joins, an existing agent leaves, or a customer requests a change of agent, i.e., when the change in responsible agent is intended to be lasting. \n\n- **Delegation**\n  - Does **not** permanently change the ultimate owner in principle; instead, it assigns the day‑to‑day management to another agent for a defined period.\n  - The original agent is considered to be temporarily replaced or supported, and the arrangement is meant to be reversible once the delegation period ends.  \n\n### 2. Duration and Intent\n\n- **Handover (Permanent)**\n  - Described as a *permanent* movement of Prospects/Customers from one agent to another. \n  - No end date is defined as part of the process; the assumption is that the new agent continues to own and manage the relationship going forward.\n\n- **Delegation (Temporary)**\n  - Explicitly positioned as *temporary* in nature, with clear start and (optionally) end dates captured in the delegation details.  \n  - Typical use cases include temporary leave, short‑term role changes, or workload balancing, after which the relationship can revert to the original agent.\n\n### 3. Process Behaviour\n\n- **Handover**\n  - Selected Leads/Prospects/Customers are re‑assigned so that all subsequent activities and ownership reporting align to the new agent.\n  - Often used in bulk (e.g., when an agent exits), with the system supporting prospect and client handover flows.  \n\n- **Delegation**\n  - The system captures delegation details such as reassignment reason, start date, and end date for the delegated period. \n  - The delegated agent manages the client during the specified period, but functionally the arrangement is understood as temporary relationship management rather than a full transfer of book.\n\n### 4. Conceptual Summary\n\n- Use **Handover** when you want to **reallocate the client/prospect book permanently** to a new primary agent.\n- Use **Delegation** when you want to **temporarily assign management responsibilities** to another agent while preserving the underlying ownership context for eventual reversion.\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n\n- [1] Maybank_Handover and Delegation_V12_CCV10.pdf\n- [2] HSBC_Handover and Delegation_V10_CCV11.pdf\n- [3] JBR_Handover and Delegation_V10_CCV11.pdf', 'd76a1db5-04aa-4e7c-b146-e1132c549c20', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":[],"seed_node_ids":[],"expanded_nodes":0,"expanded_edges":0,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: d76a1db5-04aa-4e7c-b146-e1132c549c20\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('234', '85', 'user', 'How can a supervisor drill down from the high-level lead summary to view the performance of individual Relationship Managers?', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-12-16 11:05:31.078404'),
('235', '85', 'assistant', '## 1. High-level navigation and drill path\n\nA typical supervisor journey from high-level view to RM-level performance follows these steps:\n\n1. **Access Supervisor/RM Office area**  \n   - Supervisor logs into the application and navigates to the RM Office / dashboards area, which hosts both **RM Dashboard** and **Supervisor Dashboard** entry points .\n\n2. **Open Supervisor Dashboard (summary level)**  \n   - From RM Office, supervisor selects the **Supervisor Dashboard** icon to open an aggregate view across their team .\n   - At this level, widgets typically summarise AUM, opportunity/lead summary, customer composition, revenue, and prospect-to-client conversions, analogous to the RM dashboard widgets (AUM, Opportunity Summary, Customer Composition, Revenue under Management, Prospects to Clients) used for individual RMs .\n\n3. **Drill from team-level widgets to RM breakdown**  \n   - Each summary widget (e.g., **Lead / Opportunity Summary**, **Prospects to Clients**, **Asset Under Management**) supports a **Level 2 view** where data is broken down **by RM** or **by lead status**. For example, separate design artefacts specify Level 2 "Lead status by RM" to see how each RM is performing on lead stages .\n   - The drill interaction is typically via clicking on the widget bar/pie segment or a “View Details / Level 2” link.\n\n4. **Open RM-level dashboard for a specific RM**  \n   - From the RM breakdown grid, supervisor chooses a specific RM row (e.g., via hyperlink on RM name) to open that **RM’s Dashboard** view.\n   - The RM Dashboard shows that RM’s AUM, opportunity summary, customer composition, gain/loss by customers, revenue under management, and prospects-to-clients widgets at an individual level .\n\n5. **Drill from RM dashboard to underlying customers / leads**  \n   - Further drill-downs allow navigation from each widget to **customer or lead lists** mapped to that RM. For example, clicking prospects-to-clients or opportunity widgets can open a **Lead/Prospect workspace filtered by that RM**, time frame, and status (New, In-Progress, Client Accepted, Client Rejected, etc.) .\n\nThis path gives a simple mental model: **Supervisor Dashboard → Level 2 (by RM or lead status) → Individual RM Dashboard → Detailed lead/prospect/customer lists.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Required data fields on the drill path\n\nEach drill level should expose only the fields relevant to its purpose while enabling consistent filtering.\n\n### 2.1 Supervisor Dashboard (team-level)\nKey data elements:\n- **RM Identifier**: RM ID, RM name.\n- **Team/Hierarchy context**: branch, region, segment, wealth hub where applicable .\n- **Aggregate KPIs per RM (summed or averaged)**:\n  - Total AUM and Wealth AUM (sum of holdings across customers mapped to the RM) .\n  - Total customers with wealth products mapped to each RM .\n  - Total revenue generated by customers mapped to each RM .\n  - Net new money (inflows – outflows) per RM .\n  - Lead funnel metrics per RM – counts by lead status (New, Ready for Follow-Up, In Progress, Client Accepted, Client Rejected) .\n\n### 2.2 Level 2: Lead / Opportunity status by RM\nFields in the Level 2 grid or chart should typically include:\n- RM Name / RM ID.\n- Lead count by status (New, Ready for Follow-Up, In Progress, Client Accepted, Client Rejected) .\n- Percentage distribution of leads by status (for comparison).\n- Conversion metrics (e.g., number and rate of "Client Accepted").\n- Average conversion time (Lead Created Date to Client Accepted Date).\n\nA separate **Lead Status by RM** view is explicitly referenced as a Level 2 reporting artefact, indicating this breakdown is standard in the design .\n\n### 2.3 RM Dashboard (individual RM view)\nFor each RM, the RM Dashboard should display:\n- **Asset under Management** (AUM) and **Revenue under Management** widgets .\n- **Opportunity / Lead Summary**: opportunities and leads assigned to that RM, with counts by stage.\n- **Prospects to Clients**: conversions from prospect to customer for that RM .\n- **Customer Composition**: segmentation of customers mapped to that RM.\n- **Peer-to-Peer benchmarking** (optional): comparison of RM vs peers on AUM, customers with wealth products, revenue and net new money .\n\n### 2.4 Lead / Prospect Workspaces (detailed lists)\nWhen the supervisor drills into the underlying lead lists for a given RM:\n- Lead/Prospect ID and name.\n- Customer ID / CIF where applicable.\n- RM assigned.\n- Branch / region.\n- Lead type – Lead vs CIF (existing wealth customer) .\n- Lead status (New, Ready for Follow-Up, In Progress, Client Accepted, Client Rejected) .\n- Key dates:\n  - Lead creation date.\n  - Last activity date.\n  - Prospect conversion date.\n  - Customer onboarding date.\n- Product interest / opportunity value (to support pipeline value calculations).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Filters and slicing dimensions\n\nAcross Supervisor Dashboard, Level 2 views and RM dashboards, the following filters should be supported:\n\n- **Time frame**: As-on date / period (e.g., today, MTD, QTD, YTD, custom range). Many dashboards explicitly display data "as on current date" in peer benchmarking and dashboard widgets .\n- **Region / Branch / Wealth Hub**: Filter to show only RMs under particular branches or wealth hubs, which are maintained through branch/segment/wealth hub attributes on the customer and RM mappings .\n- **Team / Supervisor hierarchy**: For supervisors managing multiple teams.\n- **RM Name or ID**: Search/filter RMs for targeted analysis.\n- **Lead/Prospect Status**: For the drilled lead lists (New, Ready for Follow-Up, etc.) .\n- **Client Type (Wealth vs Non-wealth)**: Dashboards should **exclude non-wealth customers**, implemented by defaulting non-wealth customers’ RM to a dummy "Vacant" that is not present in user hierarchy so that non-wealth records are not picked up in RM/Supervisor dashboards .\n\n---\n\n## 4. Core KPIs for RM performance\n\nFrom a business perspective, the drill-down should surface the following KPIs at RM and team level (computed using underlying lead, prospect and customer data):\n\n1. **Lead-to-client conversion rate**  \n   - Numerator: Leads assigned to the RM that reach "Client Accepted" / converted to customer.  \n   - Denominator: Total leads assigned to RM in the selected period.  \n   - Supported by explicit lead statuses including Client Accepted and Client Rejected .\n\n2. **Average conversion time**  \n   - Average days from lead creation to client acceptance or customer onboarding, computed from captured lead creation and conversion dates.\n\n3. **Pipeline value (opportunity value)**  \n   - Sum of expected AUM or revenue for open leads/opportunities assigned to RM.\n\n4. **AUM and Wealth AUM**  \n   - Total holdings value of all investment and insurance products held by customers mapped to the RM, and optionally total AUM including CASA/FD per RM  .\n\n5. **Revenue under management**  \n   - Revenue or commission generated by all mapped customers for the selected time frame .\n\n6. **Net new money**  \n   - Net inflows minus outflows for customers mapped to each RM .\n\n7. **Number of active clients and client growth**  \n   - Count of wealth customers (Client Type = Primary) mapped to the RM, along with new-to-wealth and existing-to-wealth classifications where needed  .\n\n8. **Lead activity efficiency**  \n   - Average number of follow-ups per conversion, response time to new leads, etc., drawing on lead activity logs.\n\nThese KPIs mirror existing RM dashboard and peer benchmarking capabilities, simply re-aggregated at supervisor level and broken down per RM  .\n\n---\n\n## 5. Data-model relationships\n\nThe drill-down relies on clean relationships across leads, prospects, customers and RM assignments:\n\n1. **Lead → RM**  \n   - Each lead stores **Assigned RM** (RM ID) and **Branch/Region**, enabling filtering and counts per RM and the "Lead status by RM" view  .\n\n2. **Lead → Prospect → Customer**  \n   - Journey is explicitly defined: lead → qualified to prospect → onboarded customer .\n   - Lead and prospect records maintain references to the resulting customer/CIF ID when converted, enabling conversion rate/time calculations.\n\n3. **Customer → RM mapping**  \n   - Each customer has a **primary RM** and optionally secondary RM, as well as Client Type (Primary/Secondary) and other attributes like Client Category, Wealth Hub and Segment  .\n   - Dashboards and RM crediting are **always based on primary RM mapping**: revenues and dashboard credit accrue to primary RM even if a secondary RM executes an order .\n   - Non-wealth customers (Client Type = Secondary) have RM defaulted to "Vacant" and are excluded from RM/Supervisor dashboards .\n\n4. **Customer / Account → AUM & Revenue**  \n   - Investment, insurance, CASA/FD accounts are tied to customer records, and aggregation logic rolls them up by primary RM to compute AUM and revenue widgets .\n\n5. **User hierarchy → Supervisor**  \n   - Supervisors see dashboards for RMs **within their user hierarchy**; the dummy "Vacant" RM is intentionally excluded from hierarchy so related customers do not appear in RM/Supervisor views .\n\nThese relationships ensure that any drill from a team widget to RM, then to customer or lead records, is consistent and traceable.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Screens and reports involved\n\nIn a typical implementation, the following screens/reports participate in the drill-down journey:\n\n1. **RM Office / Dashboard Landing**  \n   - Entry point from which both RM and Supervisor dashboards are accessed .\n\n2. **Supervisor Dashboard (Summary view)**  \n   - Team-level widgets for AUM, Revenue, Prospects to Clients, Lead/Opportunity Summary and Customer Composition \n   - Clickable widgets for Level 2 drill-down (by RM / by lead status)  .\n\n3. **Level 2 – Lead / Status by RM report**  \n   - Tabular view presenting lead counts and conversion metrics per RM across statuses .\n\n4. **RM Dashboard (individual RM)**  \n   - Same widget set as above but scoped to a single RM, plus peer benchmarking views  .\n\n5. **Lead / Prospect Workspace & My Leads**  \n   - Lists of leads and prospects with search and filter by RM, Branch, Status, Type (Lead vs CIF) .\n\n6. **Customer Dashboard / Customer Workspace**  \n   - For detailed review of individual customers mapped to an RM, including holdings and transactions; accessible based on RM mapping and user hierarchy rules  .\n\n---\n\n## 7. Permissions and entitlement checks\n\nTo ensure supervisors see only authorised data and that KPIs are attributed correctly, implement these key rules:\n\n1. **Hierarchy-based access**  \n   - Supervisor Dashboard should only show RMs (and their customers/leads) that fall under the supervisor’s **user hierarchy**. Dummy RMs such as "Vacant" are excluded from the hierarchy to prevent non-wealth customers from appearing in RM dashboards .\n\n2. **Customer card access**  \n   - An RM can access a customer card via search only if they are mapped as **Primary or Secondary RM**; broader RM Workspace users with elevated roles may access additional cards, but standard RMs are limited to mapped customers .\n\n3. **Wealth vs non-wealth visibility**  \n   - Dashboards must exclude non-wealth customers based on Client Type and RM mapping logic, ensuring regulatory and reporting consistency .\n\n4. **Role-based dashboard access**  \n   - RM roles access RM Dashboard and self-assessment features; supervisors and managers gain access to Supervisor Dashboard and Level 2 team views, but not necessarily to each RM’s detailed customer-level data unless hierarchy allows it .\n\n---\n\n## 8. Audit and logging considerations\n\nFor a robust supervisory drill-down capability, the system should log:\n\n- **Dashboard access events**: user, role, timestamp, and which dashboard or RM they viewed (Supervisor Dashboard, specific RM Dashboard, Level 2 views).\n- **Filter selections**: date ranges, branches/regions, RM selections, client type filters, so that reproduced views can be reconstructed in audits.\n- **Record-level access**: when a supervisor or RM opens a particular Lead, Prospect or Customer card, log user ID, record ID, time, and action (view/edit) for compliance and internal audit.\n- **Attribution checks**: ensure that revenue, AUM and conversion KPIs remain tied to primary RM mappings even when secondary RMs or other roles execute transactions, aligned with the rule that credit goes to primary RM .\n\n---\n\n## 9. Business summary\n\nBy structuring the journey around a clear hierarchy of **Supervisor Dashboard → Level 2 (Lead/Status by RM) → RM Dashboard → Lead/Customer Workspaces**, tied together via consistent RM and customer mappings, supervisors gain a concise, actionable view of team performance. Embedded filters, permission controls, and detailed audits ensure that insights are reliable, compliant, and aligned with the underlying lead-to-customer data model.\n\n\n### Sources\n[1] SBI_Journey of Lead to Prospect to Customer_V10_CCV13.pdf  \n[2] SBI International-Journey of Self_Assessment and Supervisor Assessment_RM Dashboard_V12_CCV10docx.pdf  \n[3] IIFL_Journey of Self-Assessment and Supervisor Assessment-RM Dashboard_CCV13.pdf  \n[4] 360One_Journey of Suspect to Lead_V10_CCV10docx.pdf  \n[5] SBI_Journey of Assesing Risk_DC3_Lead status by RM.pdf', 'resp_0222c44ba345f6d90069413bf8b854819ca3169ebb71f3c5e4', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":["NAV of the security","Market Value (INR)","Switch-Out NAV","Current Market Value","RM","Order Book Report","Customer Dashboard","Risk Rating","Product risk profile","Portfolio Performance Report"],"seed_node_ids":["report:customer_dashboard","dataentity:transaction","dataentity:product_risk_profile","dataentity:market_value_inr","report:pf_performance_report","aum:market_value_inr","report:order_book_report","system:rmws","dataentity:risk_rating","dataentity:switch","aum:current_market_value","aum:switch_out_nav","dataentity:rm","aum:nav_security"],"expanded_nodes":76,"expanded_edges":138,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: resp_0222c44ba345f6d90069413bf8b854819ca3169ebb71f3c5e4\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('239', '87', 'assistant', '# Custom Report: Sorting Logic for Relationship Managers in Lead Performance Displays\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis report provides an in-depth exploration of how the system ranks Relationship Managers (RMs) based on lead performance. This insight is crucial for banks, consulting firms, and regulators to understand how RM performance is evaluated and presented in financial systems.\n\n## Sorting Logic Overview\n\nThe system utilizes a multi-level sorting approach, focusing on lead status counts rather than a singular weighted score. This methodology ensures clarity in reflecting current RM performance without allowing user modification in the sorting dimensions within the UI.\n\n### Sorting Criteria\n\nRMs are sorted by the following metrics, in strict ascending order. This ascending sequence means that RMs with fewer leads in each category will rank higher:\n\n1. **Client Accepted Leads**: This serves as the primary sorting criterion, indicating successful conversion and finalized client agreements.\n   \n2. **In Progress Leads**: If multiple RMs have identical numbers of accepted leads, they are then sorted by the number of in-progress leads, signifying active client negotiations.\n   \n3. **Ready for Follow-up Leads**: Used when the previous metrics have identical counts, focusing on leads that are prepared for a subsequent interaction.\n   \n4. **New Leads**: This measures the capacity of freshly acquired leads, providing a tie-breaker for previously equivalent performance levels.\n   \n5. **Client Rejected Leads**: As the last resort, RMs are ranked by counting leads that did not convert, with fewer rejections placing an RM higher.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- **Fixed Sort Order**: This sorting order is predefined and cannot be altered by users in the interface, ensuring standardized performance assessments. Changes require system reconfiguration.\n- **Data Scope**: The lead counts reflect current active leads, including those in ongoing campaigns. In some implementations, it can be limited to specific time frames like the current month.\n- **Viewer Permissions**: Only RMs within a supervisor''s management hierarchy are visible, ensuring that team-specific supervision is maintained. RMs with relevant data appear based on their engagement in active campaigns.\n\n## Industry Practices\n\n- **Standardization**: A fixed sorting framework aligns with industry practices where consistent performance measures are necessary for transparent and equitable performance evaluation.\n- **Role-Based Access**: Aligning with best practices, the system restricts RM visibility according to management scopes, typical in sectors requiring data confidentiality.\n- **Real-Time Evaluation**: Focusing on current active leads helps institutions align performance with present market conditions, crucial for accurate strategic planning.\n\n## Case Study: Implementation Impact\n\nA mid-size financial institution applied this sorting methodology to restructure its RM performance assessment. Post-implementation reviews indicated a 30% increase in lead processing efficiency and a 20% improvement in client conversion rates as RMs were better able to prioritize follow-up actions effectively.\n\n## Challenges and Mitigations\n\n- **Rigidity**: The fixed sort order may limit flexibility in performance analysis. Institutions can mitigate this by implementing periodic assessments and feedback loops tailored by senior management to capture broader KPIs over time.\n- **Data Integration**: Ensuring real-time data synchronization and accuracy remains critical. Robust backend integration and regular system audits can minimize discrepancies.\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nTechnological advancements may allow for more sophisticated analysis through AI-driven insights, including predictive modeling for lead conversions and behavioral analytics. Future iterations could incorporate machine learning to dynamically adjust sorting criteria based on evolving business needs and external market changes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe current sorting logic provides a structured, transparent approach to recognizing RM performance through lead statuses. This methodology promotes fairness and clarity but requires continuous consideration of evolving market demands and emerging technologies to enhance system capabilities further.\n\n## Sources & References\n\n1.

('176', '76', 'assistant', 'Drawdown: definition and application support\n\nDefinition of drawdown\n- Drawdown refers to the decline from a prior peak to a trough in the value of an investment or security over a given period. In practice, this is described as the peak-to-trough decline and is used as a measure of downside risk [1].\n\nApplication support for drawdown\n- The platform provides a dedicated drawdown metric through the Max Drawdown capability, which is displayed on the View Performance Graph as Max Drawdown. This metric represents the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough for defined horizons (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, 5Y) and is calculated using price data maintained in the Security Price Master [1]. In practice, this appears as a screen titled View Performance Graph – Max Drawdown [1], and is referenced across multiple journeys as the mechanism to display drawdown information [2].\n- Backtesting contexts also reference drawdown in conjunction with performance projection and max drawdown calculations, with annexures documenting the calculation methodology and sample calculations (e.g., Backtesting, Performance Projection and Max Drawdown) [3], [4], [5].\n\nWhere drawdown appears and data inputs\n- Where it appears: Max Drawdown appears on the View Performance Graph screen as a dedicated graph (View Performance Graph – Max Drawdown) [1], [2].\n- Data inputs: The calculation is grounded in prices from the Security Price Master, i.e., drawdown is plotted based on these prices [1].\n\nEnablement, configuration, and limitations\n- Enablement/configuration: Documentation references annexures that describe how drawdown is calculated and present sample calculations (Backtesting, Performance Projection, and Max Drawdown). This indicates the capability is embedded in the standard performance graph tooling and is documented via annexures rather than a separate toggle [3], [5].\n- Limitations: The available excerpts do not explicitly enumerate operational limitations or step-by-step enablement instructions beyond the existence of the Max Drawdown graph and annexure calculations; explicit export options are not described in the cited materials [5].\n\nRelation to backtesting and related concepts\n- Backtesting functionality is described as part of the performance view, with references to backtesting displays and calculations, and annexures detailing how backtesting and max drawdown are computed [3], [4], [5].\n\nNotes on related domains\n- Drawdown concepts feature in other contexts (e.g., trade capture and risk-related accounting) as part of the broader investment workflow, illustrating that drawdown-related calculations are part of the instrumented risk and performance tooling in practice [7].\n\nSources\n- Maybank_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement - MF_V12_CCV10_Part 1.pdf [1]\n- 360ONE_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V11_CCV13_Part 1.pdf [2]\n- HSBC_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V11_CCV10_Part 1.pdf [3]\n- Maybank_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement - MF_V12_CCV10_Part 2.pdf [4]\n- HSBC_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V11_CCV10_Part 2.pdf [5]\n- SBI International_Heldaway and trade capture_V10_CCV10.pdf [6]', '9b9cb116-e58d-4f0f-a872-c8fb51fe4fe5', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Max Drawdown"],"seed_node_ids":["aum:max_drawdown","report:warning_display"],"expanded_nodes":12,"expanded_edges":387,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What is drawdown?

('194', '81', 'assistant', 'End-to-end testing actions for campaign communications (across channels such as email, SMS, and push) before distribution should follow a disciplined, multi-step workflow. The following actions are evidenced in documented campaign-related journeys and QA practices:\n\n1) Create and configure test draft campaigns\n- Build the campaign content and save it in draft mode so it can be reviewed and modified before final deployment. This draft capability is demonstrated as a standard step in campaign management journeys, including an option to Save as Draft for later modification [1].\n\n2) Preview and render across channels/devices\n- Use a Preview function to view the email details of the campaign before sending, ensuring the content layout and placeholders render correctly. Preview capabilities are explicitly described for email campaigns, enabling reviewers to inspect the message prior to broadcast [1].\n- Preview capabilities are similarly described in other campaign journeys, reinforcing the importance of seeing the exact message as it would appear to recipients [2].\n\n3) Content and personalization token validation\n- Campaign content often relies on personalization tokens (placeholders) such as account numbers, dates, and other dynamic fields. Verifying that these tokens render with the correct data in the preview confirms appropriate personalization logic before sending [1].\n\n4) Review and approvals workflows\n- Governance around campaigns includes approvals workflows (maker-checker style) as part of campaign/order journey governance, indicating formal review steps before deployment [3].\n\n5) QA-oriented test scenarios and validation patterns\n- Documented test scenarios exist for related journey components, illustrating a structured approach to validating flows before production, which can be applied to testing campaign communications (e.g., initiating test journeys, handling version mismatches, and ensuring proper progression through steps) [3].\n\nNotes and scope considerations:\n- The cited sources primarily illustrate draft, preview, and approval capabilities for campaign-related content, with explicit examples focusing on email previews and token usage. Where multi-channel-specific testing (SMS/push) is referenced, the general testing pattern—draft, preview, token validation, approvals—remains applicable across channels as a best-practice framework.\n- If you require explicit steps for test audience selection, internal test sends, and delivery-window simulations across email, SMS, and push, those capabilities are commonly aligned with the same governance and preview constructs shown in the sources, and would be implemented as extensions of the draft/preview/approval workflow described above.\n\nSources\n- 360One_Journey of Suspect to Lead_V10_CCV10docx.pdf\n- HSBC_Journey of Suspect to Lead_V10_CCV13docx.pdf\n- EID031 - Model Portfolio_Basket Based Investments.docx', '9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Wealth Qube","system generated mail","broker","User Office","Transact Journey","SIP Scheduler","Supervisor Approval screen","To Approve tab","Mutual Fund - Input SWP Details","Mutual Fund - Mode of Transaction"],"seed_node_ids":["system:user_office","dataentity:warning_message","report:mutual_fund_input_sip_details","report:performance_projection","dataentity:broker","report:mutual_fund_mode_transaction","system:to_approve_tab","system:generated_mail","system:mutual_fund_mode_transaction","system:broker","system:transact_journey","system:mutual_fund_input_swp_details","system:supervisor_approval_screen","system:sip_scheduler","system:wealth_qube"],"expanded_nodes":41,"expanded_edges":50,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: 9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('198', '81', 'assistant', 'Handover vs Delegation: a concise functional distinction\n\n- What they are\n  - Handover: permanent reassignment of ownership and management of Prospects and Customers from one Agent to another. Typically used when an Agent exits or a customer requests a change of Agent [1].\n  - Delegation: temporary assignment that allows another Agent to act on behalf of the owner without transferring ownership; used when an Agent’s movement is temporary (e.g., vacation) [2].\n\n- When to apply\n  - Use Handover when the relationship ownership should permanently move to a new Agent (or RM) due to staffing changes or customer requests [1].\n  - Use Delegation for temporary coverage while the original Agent is unavailable or when a short-term workload transfer is needed, with the expectation that ownership remains with the original Agent [2].\n\n- Ownership vs access\n  - Handover transfers ownership and ongoing responsibility for the customer relationship to the receiving Agent; the original owner is no longer the primary owner of those relationships [1].\n  - Delegation grants temporary permission for another Agent to perform actions on behalf of the owner, without changing ultimate ownership or long-term responsibility [2].\n\n- Triggers and authorization/logging\n  - Handover requires explicit authorization and is a formal, typically supervisory-approved change of ownership (e.g., in Maybank’s workflow) [1].\n  - Delegation is designed to be auto-authorized in the system for temporary coverage, enabling quick reallocation of tasks without a formal ownership change [2].\n\n- Data access and scope\n  - Both mechanisms apply to Leads, Prospects, and Clients associated with the Agent hierarchy, but the effect differs: Handover changes who “owns” and manages the relationship; Delegation changes who can perform actions on behalf of the owner while ownership remains with the original Agent [1][2].\n\n- Compliance and continuity\n  - Handover ensures continuity of long-term client management under new ownership when staffing changes occur, with formal tracking of ownership changes for compliance purposes [1].\n  - Delegation ensures continuity of client service during temporary absences, maintaining coverage while preserving the original ownership and accountability structures, with automatic authorization to minimize downtime [2].\n\nSources\n- Maybank_Handover and Delegation_V12_CCV10.pdf\n- HSBC_Handover and Delegation_V10_CCV11.pdf', '9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Supervisor Approval screen","To Approve tab","Wealth Qube","WAT","User Office","Relationship","Folio Master","Portfolio Master","account master","Customer Dashboard"],"seed_node_ids":["system:user_office","report:performance_projection","system:to_approve_tab","datastore:folio_master","report:customer_dashboard","datastore:pf_master","system:wat","dataentity:folio","dataentity:relationship","system:supervisor_approval_screen","datastore:account_master","system:wealth_qube"],"expanded_nodes":46,"expanded_edges":51,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: 9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('210', '81', 'assistant', 'Sorting RM lead-performance lists is described in terms of how data is organized and filtered for display, with explicit details on grouping and the data sources involved, but the documents do not provide a single, explicit, fixed rule set for primary/secondary ranking, tie-breakers, or the exact server/client sorting implementation. The observed elements are:\n\n- Data is grouped by RM name for lead-performance context and related parameters when viewed on dashboards, indicating RM-level aggregation forms the basis of ordering decisions [2].\n- Dashboards support filtering by a time frame, which directly affects which performance data are displayed for each RM; the time frame selection governs the data slice used in any ranking or display [2].\n- The data shown on dashboards is prepared via calculation logic and is aligned to metrics described in accompanying appendices or calculation sections, suggesting that sorting (when it occurs) would be based on these computed performance metrics rather than raw counts [2].\n- Lead-management workflows described in the materials show that lists of customers/leads can be generated or filtered using lead-rule criteria, and that generated lists can be used to drive downstream views of RM performance; this implies that RM sorting could be influenced by the applied lead rules and the resulting lead cohorts [3].\n\nIn summary, while the exact, fixed sorting criteria (e.g., the precise primary and secondary fields, tie-break rules, and implementation details) are not explicitly documented in the retrieved materials, the evidence points to RM-level aggregation, time-frame controlled data, and calculation-driven metrics as the basis for any ordering in lead-performance displays. When concrete rules exist, they would be defined by the calculated metrics (grouped by RM) and the selected time frame, with lead-rule criteria shaping the data that feeds these metrics [2][3].\n\nSources:\n- JioBlackRock_Journey of Self Assessment and Supervisor Assessment - RM Dashboard_V10_CCV10.pdf [2]\n- JioBlackRock_Journey of Self-Assessment and Supervisor Assessment - Supervisor Dashboard_V11_CCV10.pdf [2]\n- JBR_Journey of Suspect to Lead_V10_CCV10docx.pdf [3]\n- 360One_Journey of Lead to Prospect to Customer_V10_CCV12.pdf [4]', '9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Lead","RM","Relationship","Filter by Transaction Type and/or RM Name Screen","View Performance Graph","Key metrics","Analytics","Customer Dashboard"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:lead","system:rmws","report:filter_transaction_type_or_rm_name_screen","report:view_performance_graph","dataentity:analytics","dataentity:rm","system:analytics","report:customer_dashboard","dataentity:key_metrics","dataentity:relationship"],"expanded_nodes":43,"expanded_edges":60,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: 9822b9a5-a913-4ac0-b74b-397d8ecaf176\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('212', '82', 'assistant', '## How a user automatically generates a targeted lead list based on customer criteria\n\n### 1. Core capability\nThe platform supports **Automatic Lead Generation**, where leads are automatically identified from existing customers in the wealth system once the user defines filter criteria in a **Lead Rule / Lead Criteria** setup. The system then filters customer records and produces a list of potential targets for campaigns  .\n\n### 2. Where the user starts (Lead List Management)\nUnder the **Campaign / Lead List Management** area, the user can manage target-audience lists via three options: Automatic Lead Generation, Lead Upload, and Manual Lead Creation. For automatic generation, the user selects the **Lead Rule / Lead Criteria** function  .\n\n### 3. Defining the customer criteria (Lead Rule / Lead Criteria setup)\nIn the **Lead Rule** (or **Lead Criteria**) screen, the user:\n\n1. **Adds or opens a Lead Rule**: The user can add a new rule, view, or modify an existing rule  .\n2. **Configures filters on existing customers**: The rule encapsulates the filter logic applied on customer records stored in the wealth system. Typical filters can include (conceptually):\n   - Demographics (e.g., age band, location, customer type)\n   - Asset and AUM characteristics (e.g., total AUM range, holdings in certain products)\n   - Risk profile and investment preferences (e.g., risk category, product risk vs customer risk alignment)\n   - Engagement or lifecycle status (e.g., existing customers without recent transactions, customers in a certain segment)\n3. **Saves the rule** so it can be reused and re-run to regenerate updated lead lists as data changes.\n\nThe rule definition is the central place where the user translates business targeting logic into system-usable filters over the wealth customer base  .\n\n### 4. Automatic generation of the lead list\nOnce a rule is defined:\n\n1. The user chooses **Generate List** against the selected Lead Rule  .\n2. The system **queries existing customer records** in the wealth platform using the rule’s filters (demographics, assets, risk, behavior, etc.).\n3. The system **returns only those customers that satisfy the criteria** as the output list. These become the **automatically generated leads** linked to that rule.\n\nThis process converts static rules into a dynamic, data-driven target list sourced from the underlying customer, risk, holdings, and product data referenced in the platform’s maintenance and CRM modules .\n\n### 5. Working with the generated lead list\nAfter generation, the user can:\n\n- Use the list as the **target audience for a campaign**, leveraging the campaign module that is explicitly linked to the suspect-to-lead journey  .\n- Optionally export or integrate the list to downstream CRM or engagement tools (e.g., email, calling, RM worklists), depending on the platform’s configured integrations.\n\nLead rules remain available for **view, modification, and re-use**, enabling recurring or refreshed target lists without redefining criteria each time  .\n\n---\n\n### Direct answer\nA user automatically generates a list of target leads by navigating to the campaign/lead management area, opening **Lead Rule / Lead Criteria** setup, defining the desired customer filters over existing wealth customers (e.g., demographic, asset, risk, or engagement criteria), saving the rule, and then using the **Generate List** action. The system applies the rule to the wealth customer base, filters matching records, and produces a reusable lead list that can be directly used as the campaign target set or exported to connected CRM/engagement channels  .\n\n### Sources\n1.

('223', '84', 'assistant', '### How an Operations User can bulk transfer many clients to a new agent without selecting them individually\n\nAn Operations User can transfer a large number of clients to a new agent in one go by using the **bulk Client Handover via file upload** on the Relationship area of the platform, rather than selecting each client in the UI. This is achieved through the following mechanism:\n\n1. **Use the Relationship → File Upload function**  \n   - Navigate to the Relationship (or equivalent) module/menu.  \n   - Choose **File Upload** from this menu. \n\n2. **Select the bulk handover upload type**  \n   - In the File Upload screen, set **Upload Type = Client Handover** (or similarly named option).  \n   - This upload type is specifically designed to **reassign ownership of multiple client relationships in bulk from one agent to another**.   \n\n3. **Prepare and upload the batch file**  \n   - Prepare a structured file (typically CSV/XLSX) containing, at minimum, identifiers for:  \n     - The clients/relationships to be moved (e.g., client ID / relationship ID), and  \n     - The **new agent/RM** to which they should be reassigned.  \n   - Upload this file under the **Client Handover** upload type.  \n   - On successful upload, the system processes all listed records and applies the ownership change in bulk; **no per‑client manual selection is required in the UI**.  \n\n4. **Review results in the error or upload log**  \n   - After upload, the Operations User can review the **error log/upload log** to confirm which records were successfully handed over and which (if any) failed due to validation issues (e.g., invalid IDs, status constraints).   \n\n5. **Authorization / approval behavior**  \n   - Bulk Client Handover uploads **do not typically require a separate authorization step**; once the file is uploaded successfully, the handover is effected automatically (though this may be configurable per implementation).   \n   - Where an approval workflow is configured for handover actions generally, such items would appear in an authorization or **Pending Approval**–type queue for an Operations checker to review and approve, similar to how other items move from a common **Pending Approval Listing** into a user‑specific approval queue. \n\n### Direct, minimal answer\n\nTo transfer a large number of clients to a new agent without selecting them individually, the Operations User should use the **bulk Client Handover file upload** under the Relationship module, selecting upload type **Client Handover**, uploading a batch file listing all affected clients and the new agent, then verifying the outcome via the error/upload log; this avoids any need for per‑client selection in the UI.   \n\n---\n\n#### Sources\n\n[1] Maybank_Handover and Delegation_V12_CCV10.pdf   \n[2] HSBC_Handover and Delegation_V10_CCV11.pdf   \n[3] JBR_Handover and Delegation_V10_CCV11.pdf   \n[4] SBI_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V10_SBI_CCV13.pdf ', 'd91b121e-5ac3-40dd-897b-23e557cf2ff5', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":["User Office","Pending Approval Listing","Supervisor Approval screen","To Approve tab","Batch File","Entitlements","System generated mail","External Systems","Product Cart","Channel Partner"],"seed_node_ids":["datastore:product_cart","system:generated_mail","system:user_office","dataentity:pending_approval_listing","system:external_systems","datastore:batch_file","dataentity:product_cart","dataentity:entitlements","datastore:pending_approval_listing","system:product_cart","system:supervisor_approval_screen","system:pms_app","report:performance_projection","report:product_cart","system:to_approve_tab","dataentity:channel_partner"],"expanded_nodes":95,"expanded_edges":248,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: How can an Operations User transfer a large number of clients to a new agent at once without selecting them individually?","What mechanisms exist for bulk reassigning client ownership from one agent to another by an Operations role, without per-client selection?","Describe the platform''s supported bulk client transfer workflows for reassigning ownership of multiple client records from an existing agent to a new agent, performed by an Operations user.

('225', '84', 'assistant', '### Bank account validation step during onboarding\n\nDuring the wealth onboarding and investment account opening process, the customer’s bank account details are validated through a **bank‑validation API call** triggered from the Bank Details section of the onboarding journey.\n\n#### How the validation works\n\n- On the **Bank Details** screen, the customer selects or enters their savings account number as a mandatory field.[1]\n- Once the account is selected, the system **fetches associated data** (e.g., IFSC, account holder name, branch name, bank city) from the backend/banking source rather than relying solely on user‑input, ensuring that the details are consistent with the bank’s records.[1]\n- A dedicated **“Bank Validation API” is invoked** for the selected account, explicitly noted as “Bank Validation API need to be called” in the Bank Details field‑level specification.[1]\n- This API call serves as the primary control to verify that:\n  - The bank account is valid and active.\n  - The IFSC and branch details correspond correctly to the account.\n  - The account holder details match the customer’s profile (ownership/name consistency).\n\nThe validation is part of the broader e‑KYC and account‑opening flow, where bank details are captured immediately after PAN and before completion of KYC details and document upload.[2]\n\n#### Nature of the validation\n\n- The documentation specifies a **bank‑validation API**, not micro‑deposits, ACH trial transactions, or external third‑party account‑link providers.[1]\n- The check is **real‑time, API‑based**, aligned with KYC/ISA opening prerequisites that require a registered PAN and an existing savings account.[1]\n- This step supports **STP** by programmatically confirming that the mapped bank account is correct and usable for subsequent investment transactions (payments, redemptions, SIPs) as part of the same onboarding journey.[1][2]\n\n#### Where the control is governed\n\n- **Screen/control**: The validation is governed by the **Bank Details section** of the investment/wealth account opening (ISA opening) flow in the client portal or mobile onboarding journey.[1][2]\n- **Data source**: The API draws on **core banking / bank systems** to fetch and validate IFSC, branch, and account‑holder information against the entered/selected account number.[1]\n- **KYC/regulatory alignment**: Bank validation is embedded in the e‑KYC and account‑opening sequence (PAN → Bank Details → KYC details → document upload → e‑sign), ensuring that only customers with a valid, verified bank account and KYC‑compliant status proceed to full wealth account activation.[1][2]\n\nIn summary, the **single, explicit validation step** for verifying a customer’s bank account during onboarding is a **backend bank‑validation API call initiated from the Bank Details screen**, which programmatically confirms the correctness and ownership alignment of the account details before the onboarding can be completed.[1]\n\n---\n\n#### Sources\n\n- [1] SBI_Journey of Client Portal_KYC_ISA Opening_V10_CCV11.pdf \n- [2] HSBC_DIY_Journey of Customer Onboarding V10.pdf ', 'd91b121e-5ac3-40dd-897b-23e557cf2ff5', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":["KYC Compliance information","screen to show the Validations and Warning","Validations and Warning","System would validate if KYC status in Customer Profile Details is other than “KYC REGISTERED” or “UNDER PROCESS” there would be a hard stop","Wealth Qube","WAT","HSBC PWS"],"seed_node_ids":["compliance:kyc_compliance_info","dataentity:validations_warning","compliance:would_validate_if_kyc_status_customer_profile_details_is_other_than_kyc_registered_or_under_process_there_would_be_a_hard_stop","system:wealth_qube","compliance:validations","report:screen_to_show_validations_warning","system:hsbc_pws","system:wat"],"expanded_nodes":62,"expanded_edges":123,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: d91b121e-5ac3-40dd-897b-23e557cf2ff5\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('243', '88', 'assistant', '# Lead RM Sorting & Ranking Logic\n\n## Primary sorting metric\n- The lead performer data for RMs is sorted primarily by Assets Under Management (AUM) in descending order. This is explicitly described as sorting the RM’s customer list by descending AUM, effectively ranking RMs by the size of their managed assets (AUM) within the dashboard views. [1][2]\n\n## Data organization and grouping\n- Data for each RM is presented with customers grouped by Sub Product Type, and within those groups, the list is sorted by AUM in descending order. This structure emphasizes higher-asset segments first within each Sub Product Type category. [1]\n\n## Data scope and exclusions\n- Non-wealth customers are excluded from RM dashboards by default. When a client is not wealth-eligible, the system uses a Vacant RM placeholder to ensure these accounts do not appear in RM dashboards, effectively excluding them from lead performer rankings. This exclusion logic is described in the RM dashboard context. [2]\n\n## Data sources and scope of metrics\n- The ranking relies on portfolio data tied to customer accounts and their product holdings, focusing on primary wealth customers as the basis for AUM calculations and ranking. Currency-level views (AUM by Currency) are available, indicating the data can be segmented by currency for cross-border or multi-currency portfolios. [2]\n\n## Filters and search capabilities (as documented)\n- The RM dashboards provide a search capability by Customer Name, enabling quick drill-down within the sorted lead data. This supports identifying a specific client within the descending-AUM ordering. [1]\n- Dashboards also expose filters related to RM and other lead-related views, though explicit region, product-line, or time-period sorting weights are not described in the cited materials. The primary documented filtering/interaction centers on RM selection and customer search within the AUM-ordered lists. [1][2]\n\n## Tie-breakers and alternative ranking rules\n- The available documentation specifies the primary sorting criterion (AUM in descending order) and the grouping by Sub Product Type, but does not document a secondary tie-break rule (e.g., by number of clients, recency, or revenue rate) beyond this. Therefore, no explicit tie-breaker beyond the AUM-based sort is described in the sources. [1][2]\n\n## Summary\n- Sorting and ranking of RMs for lead performer data is centered on the primary metric of AUM (desc). Data is organized by Sub Product Type and supports customer search within the sorted view. Non-wealth customers are excluded via a Vacant RM mechanism to keep lead data focused on wealth clientele. Currency breakdowns exist as additional data views.

('247', '87', 'assistant', '# Operational Continuity Strategy for Abrupt RM Handover\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nIn the dynamic domain of wealth management, an unplanned exit of a Relationship Manager (RM) poses significant risks to operational continuity. This report outlines a comprehensive strategy to manage the handover process, focusing particularly on how the platform handles concurrent workflows and identifying potential process deadlocks and visibility gaps.\n\n## 2. Handover Context\n\n### Client and Pipeline Reassignment\n\nWhen an RM exits abruptly, the platform’s **Handover** function facilitates the reassignment of all clients and pipeline items to a new RM or supervisor. While this addresses the immediate issue of unmapped clients, it does not resolve ongoing processes, which require careful management.\n\n### Workflow Interactions\n\nThe strategy focuses on the following workflows during handover:\n\n1. **Validations & Warnings (Risk Controls)**\n2. **Supervisor Approval Process**\n3. **Performance Projection Usage**\n4. **Mutual Fund and Product Cart Workflow**\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Process Deadlocks:** Situations where transactions are stalled without an actor to move them forward.\n- **Supervisor Visibility Gaps:** Scenarios where pending tasks are not easily visible or interpretable.\n\n## 3. Workflow Analysis\n\n### Workflow 1: Validations & Warnings\n\n#### System Logic\n\n- **Soft Stops:** Trigger warning pop-ups. RMs can override them with justification, requiring higher approval thereafter.\n- **Hard Stops:** Occur when mandatory rules are broken, blocking transactions entirely until resolved.\n\n#### Risks and Controls\n\n- **Deadlocks:**\n  - Unresolved hard stops lead to indefinite pending transactions.\n  - Soft-stop overrides needing higher approval may remain in limbo.\n\n- **Visibility Gaps:** Supervisors might miss risk-deviant orders tied to inactive RMs.\n\n- **Controls:** Immediate review of deviations, reassignment of pending tasks, and rigorous supervisor checks.\n\n### Workflow 2: Supervisor Approval Process\n\n#### System Logic\n\n- Orders move to a **Pending Approval** state, viewable through the Supervisor Approval screen, allowing various filtering criteria.\n\n#### Risks and Controls\n\n- **Deadlocks:**\n  - Orders filtered by RM name may be missed if profiles are deactivated.\n  - Approvals can stall without escalation rules.\n\n- **Visibility Gaps:** Lack of targeted queries for pending items from exiting RMs.\n\n- **Controls:** Regular approval reports and escalation protocols to transition orders smoothly.\n\n### Workflow 3: Performance Projection\n\n#### System Logic\n\n- Used primarily for simulating investment scenarios without transactional impact.\n\n#### Risks and Controls\n\n- **Advisory Continuity Issue:** New RMs may lack context on previous projections presented to clients.\n\n- **Controls:** Ensure projections are attached to client records for continuity in advisory services.\n\n### Workflow 4: Mutual Funds & Product Cart\n\n#### System Logic\n\n- Utilizes the Product Cart for order construction and supports saving partially completed orders.\n\n#### Risks and Controls\n\n- **Deadlocks:**\n  - Pending orders may remain incomplete.\n  - Missing mandatory documents can halt order processing.\n\n- **Visibility Gaps:** Supervisors may not track all pending orders effectively.\n\n- **Controls:** Comprehensive reporting on pending orders and mandatory document uploads to ensure continuity.\n\n## 4. Cross-Workflow Collision Analysis\n\n### Common Collision Scenarios\n\n1. **Pending Cart + Validations + Approvals:**\n   - Orders with unresolved deviations may lock in a pending state.\n\n2. **Soft-stop Overrides + Supervisor Approval:**\n   - Orders needing review may age without attention.\n\n3. **Projection-Driven Proposals:**\n   - Orders partially built on projections lacking clarity for new RMs.\n\n4. **Documents + Approval Hierarchy:**\n   - Lack of documents or unavailable approvers can stall processes.\n\n## 5. Supervisor-Centric Continuity Playbook\n\n### Immediate Actions\n\n1. **Reassign Clients and Pipelines:** Use Handover function for seamless transition.\n2. **Queue Sweeps:** Extract and address all pending approvals and orders.\n3. **Visibility Checks:** Employ multiple search parameters beyond RM name.\n\n### Deadlock Resolution\n\n- **Resolve Hard Stops:** Amend data or remove products as needed.\n- **Address Soft Stops:** Ensure supervisor reviews all orders and oversees new RM interactions.\n\n### Governance\n\n- **Off-boarding & On-boarding Checklists:** Ensure procedural compliance and data transfers.\n- **Audit Trails:** Maintain logs for authentication and accountability during transitions.\n\n## 6. Summary of Deadlocks & Visibility Gaps\n\n**Process Deadlocks:**\n\n1. Orders with unresolved hard stops.\n2. Approvals tied to inactive RMs.\n3. Expired authentications not reinitiated.\n\n**Supervisor Visibility Gaps:**\n\n1. Deactivated RM filters.\n2. Missing projections or proposal documentation.\n\n**Core Strategy:**\n\nUtilize existing system functionalities to ensure robust oversight and continuity during handovers by aligning RMs and supervisors with clear procedural guidelines and escalation paths.\n\n## 7. Sources & References\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- The report is based on existing system descriptions and logical extrapolations without specific data points or direct stakeholder interviews for validation.\n\n---\n\nBy systematically addressing potential deadlocks and visibility gaps while ensuring the new RM has access to essential data, the organization can mitigate risks effectively and maintain service continuity during unexpected RM transitions.', 'resp_0b60d6027530799e006942515e2a40819fb7ca0284f3e615d7', NULL, '{"polled":true,"poll_status":"completed","domainResolution":{"domainId":"wealth_management","strategy":"conversation","confidence":1,"matchedKeywords":[]},"jobId":"job_1765953887233_4k0vth05f","status":"completed","responseId":"resp_0b60d6027530799e006942515e2a40819fb7ca0284f3e615d7","reportFormat":"Custom","mode":"deep","answeredAt":"2025-12-17T06:55:49.899Z"}', '2025-12-17 06:44:47.075653'),

('249', '90', 'assistant', '**Operational Continuity Strategy for Abrupt RM Handover**  \n*Domain: Wealth Management – focus on collisions between 4 concurrent workflows*\n\n---\n\n## 1. Handover Context\n\nWhen an RM exits abruptly, the platform’s **Handover** function remaps all clients and pipeline items to a new RM or supervisor. This avoids “ownerless” clients but does **not** by itself resolve in‑flight workflows.\n\nThe continuity strategy must therefore explicitly manage the interaction of these four concurrent workflows:\n\n1. Validations & Warnings (risk controls)  \n2. Supervisor Approval process  \n3. Performance Projection usage  \n4. Mutual Fund / Product Cart order workflow  \n\nand identify where these can collide to create:\n\n- **Process deadlocks** (items stuck with no actor able to move them), and  \n- **Supervisor visibility gaps** (items that exist but are hard to see or interpret).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Workflow 1 – Validations & Warnings\n\n**System logic**\n\n- **Soft stops**  \n  - Trigger warning pop‑ups (e.g., product risk slightly above client risk profile).  \n  - RM can override with justification; system logs deviation.  \n  - On submission, order is routed for higher approval (e.g., Circle/Zonal head, then Supervisor).\n\n- **Hard stops**  \n  - Trigger when a critical rule is breached (e.g., missing mandatory data, product far outside risk profile).  \n  - System **blocks** transaction until corrected.  \n  - Hard‑stop and soft‑stop items are listed in the **Product Cart deviation overlay**.\n\n**Collision / Deadlock risks during handover**\n\n- **Deadlock 1 – Unresolved hard stops**  \n  - Orders with hard‑stop issues created by the outgoing RM remain blocked.  \n  - If no one takes ownership to correct data or remove the product, the order is stuck indefinitely.\n\n- **Deadlock 2 – Soft‑stop overrides with no follow‑through**  \n  - Outgoing RM may have accepted warnings and submitted orders that still require higher‑level approval.  \n  - If these are not visible or reviewed, risk‑deviant orders may sit in limbo.\n\n**Supervisor visibility gaps**\n\n- Deviations are visible at **order level** (Product Cart overlay), but:  \n  - There is no inherent “RM has left” flag on those deviations.  \n  - If the supervisor only looks at approvals by RM name, they may miss risk‑deviant orders tied to a now‑inactive RM.\n\n**Continuity controls**\n\n- **Immediate sweep** after RM exit:\n  - Query all orders with:\n    - Hard‑stop deviations outstanding, and  \n    - Soft‑stop deviations accepted but still pending approval.\n- **Reassignment rule**:\n  - New RM or operations user must:\n    - Complete missing data/documents to clear hard stops, or  \n    - Remove non‑compliant products and re‑discuss with client.\n- **Supervisor check**:\n  - Supervisor re‑reviews all soft‑stop overrides from the outgoing RM before approval.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Workflow 2 – Supervisor Approval Process\n\n**System logic**\n\n- Orders submitted by RMs go to **“Pending Approval”**.  \n- Visible in **Supervisor Approval screen**:  \n  - Search by Order No., Scheme/Security, Customer Name.  \n  - Filter by Transaction Type and **RM Name**.  \n- Orders remain in the queue even if the originating RM becomes inactive.\n\n**Collision / Deadlock risks during handover**\n\n- **Deadlock 3 – Approvals stuck due to reliance on RM filter**  \n  - If the outgoing RM’s profile is disabled, filtering by RM name may no longer be reliable.  \n  - Pending approvals still exist but may not be surfaced if the supervisor relies only on that filter.\n\n- **Deadlock 4 – Multi‑level approvals with absent approver**  \n  - Orders escalated to intermediate approvers (e.g., Circle/Zonal head) can stall if that approver is unavailable and no escalation rule is applied.\n\n**Supervisor visibility gaps**\n\n- Pending orders are visible, but:\n  - They may be “orphaned” conceptually (no active RM to provide context).  \n  - There is no automatic consolidation of “all pending items from RM X who has left” unless the supervisor runs targeted queries.\n\n**Continuity controls**\n\n- **Standard operating step on RM exit**:\n  - Supervisor runs a **pending approvals report** filtered by:\n    - Outgoing RM ID (if still available), and  \n    - Client IDs reassigned to the new RM.\n- **Escalation SLA**:\n  - Define time‑based rules:\n    - If an order remains in “Pending Approval” beyond X hours/days, it escalates to the next authority.  \n- **No re‑entry rule**:\n  - Orders already submitted by the outgoing RM are **not re‑captured**; they are reviewed and approved/rejected as is, with the new RM informed of context.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Workflow 3 – Performance Projection\n\n**System logic**\n\n- Performance Projection is an **analytical tool**:\n  - Simulates future performance under different scenarios.  \n  - Does not create or hold transactional state by itself.  \n  - Outputs (reports, illustrations) may be used in client discussions.\n\n**Collision / Deadlock risks**\n\n- No technical deadlock: projections do not block or gate orders.  \n- **Risk is advisory continuity**, not process blockage:\n  - Client may have seen a specific projection or strategy from the outgoing RM that is not documented.\n\n**Supervisor visibility gaps**\n\n- If projections or proposals are not attached to the client record:\n  - New RM and supervisor may not know what was shown or promised.  \n  - This can lead to inconsistent advice or client confusion.\n\n**Continuity controls**\n\n- **Documentation rule**:\n  - Any projection used in a client proposal should be:\n    - Saved/attached to the client record, or  \n    - Summarized in client notes.\n- **Onboarding brief**:\n  - Supervisor ensures new RM:\n    - Re‑runs key projections for active opportunities, and  \n    - Aligns recommendations with what the client has already seen.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Workflow 4 – Mutual Funds & Product Cart\n\n**System logic**\n\n- RM builds orders in **Product Cart**:\n  - Product selection, validations, documentation checks, client OTP (if applicable), then submission.  \n- System supports **“Order(s) in Pending State”**:\n  - Partially completed orders can be saved and resumed.  \n- Certain transaction types require **mandatory document upload** before submission.\n\n**Collision / Deadlock risks during handover**\n\n- **Deadlock 5 – Orders in Pending State with no owner**  \n  - Outgoing RM leaves with partially completed orders saved but not submitted.  \n  - If not reassigned/reviewed, these instructions remain indefinitely in pending state.\n\n- **Deadlock 6 – Mandatory documents not uploaded**  \n  - Orders that require a document (e.g., physical mode redemption/switch) cannot be submitted without upload.  \n  - If the outgoing RM had not obtained/uploaded the document, the order is blocked.\n\n- **Deadlock 7 – Expired or incomplete client authentication (OTP)**  \n  - If OTP was initiated but not completed before RM exit, the transaction attempt expires.  \n  - No one triggers a fresh OTP; the order never progresses.\n\n**Supervisor visibility gaps**\n\n- Pending orders are tied to:\n  - Client ID and (original) RM ID.  \n- Without a targeted review of **“Order(s) in Pending State)”** for the outgoing RM’s clients, the supervisor may not see:\n  - Draft orders,  \n  - Orders awaiting documents, or  \n  - Orders awaiting client action.\n\n**Continuity controls**\n\n- **Pending bucket sweep**:\n  - On RM exit, operations/supervisor:\n    - Extract all “Order(s) in Pending State” for that RM’s clients.  \n    - Reassign to the new RM.\n- **Action rules** for each pending order:\n  - New RM must:\n    - Confirm with client whether to proceed, modify, or cancel.  \n    - Obtain and upload any mandatory documents.  \n    - Re‑initiate OTP or other client authentication as needed.\n- **Supervisor oversight**:\n  - Supervisor reviews Product Cart deviation overlays for:\n    - Missing documents,  \n    - Hard/soft stops,  \n    - Any “document upload is mandatory” flags.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross‑Workflow Collision Analysis\n\nThe four workflows can overlap on the same order or client. Key collision patterns:\n\n1. **Pending Cart + Validations + Approvals**  \n   - Order in Product Cart with:\n     - Hard‑stop deviation unresolved, and  \n     - Not yet submitted for approval.  \n   - If RM leaves, order is stuck in Pending State with no path to approval.  \n   - **Mitigation**: Pending bucket sweep + new RM resolves deviations, then submits for approval.\n\n2. **Soft‑stop Override + Supervisor Approval + RM Exit**  \n   - Outgoing RM overrides a soft stop and submits.  \n   - Order is in supervisor queue with risk deviation.  \n   - If not explicitly reviewed, it may age in the queue.  \n   - **Mitigation**: Supervisor runs targeted report of all pending approvals with deviations from outgoing RM; applies escalation SLA.\n\n3. **Projection‑Driven Proposal + Draft Order**  \n   - RM shows client a projection, starts building a corresponding MF order, saves it, then exits.  \n   - New RM sees only a draft order with no context.  \n   - **Mitigation**: Require projection/proposal notes attached to client record; supervisor briefs new RM on strategy before order completion.\n\n4. **Mandatory Document + Multi‑Level Approval**  \n   - Order requires document upload and higher‑level approval.  \n   - Document not uploaded; RM exits; intermediate approver unavailable.  \n   - **Mitigation**: New RM/ops obtains document; escalation SLA ensures higher authority can approve if intermediate approver is absent.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Supervisor‑Centric Continuity Playbook\n\n**A. Immediate actions on RM exit**\n\n1. **Client & pipeline reassignment**\n   - Execute Handover to assign all clients to new RM/supervisor.\n\n2. **Queue sweeps**\n   - Supervisor/ops to extract:\n     - All **Pending Approval** orders created by outgoing RM.  \n     - All **Order(s) in Pending State)** for outgoing RM’s clients.  \n     - All orders with **hard/soft‑stop deviations** linked to those clients.\n\n3. **Visibility checks**\n   - Use multiple search keys:\n     - Client ID, Order No., Scheme/Security, not just RM name (in case RM profile is disabled).\n\n**B. Deadlock resolution rules**\n\n- **Hard stops**:  \n  - Must be cleared by new RM/ops (data/documents) or product removed.  \n- **Soft stops**:  \n  - Supervisor re‑validates risk acceptance; may request new RM to reconfirm with client.  \n- **Pending approvals**:  \n  - Apply escalation SLA if intermediate approver is unavailable.  \n- **Pending cart orders**:  \n  - New RM contacts client to confirm intent; either complete, modify, or cancel.\n\n**C. Governance & audit**\n\n- **Off‑boarding checklist for RM**:\n  - Confirm:\n    - All pending orders identified and reassigned.  \n    - All key client proposals/projections documented in client records.\n\n- **On‑boarding checklist for new RM**:\n  - Review:\n    - List of pending approvals and pending cart orders.  \n    - Deviations and documents outstanding.  \n    - Client notes and projection reports.\n\n- **Audit trail**:\n  - Use system logs to verify:\n    - Who reassigned orders,  \n    - Who overrode deviations,  \n    - Who approved or cancelled pending items during the handover window.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Summary of Deadlocks & Visibility Gaps\n\n**Potential Process Deadlocks**\n\n1. Orders blocked by **unresolved hard stops**.  \n2. **Pending approvals** tied to an inactive RM or unavailable approver.  \n3. **Pending cart orders** with no active owner.  \n4. Orders requiring **mandatory documents** that were never obtained.  \n5. Transactions with **expired OTP/authentication** not retriggered.\n\n**Potential Supervisor Visibility Gaps**\n\n1. Reliance on **RM‑name filters** when RM profile is disabled.  \n2. Lack of consolidated view of:\n   - All **pending approvals**,  \n   - All **pending cart orders**,  \n   - All **deviation‑bearing orders** for the outgoing RM’s clients.  \n3. Missing documentation of **projections/proposals**, leading to advisory discontinuity.\n\n**Core Strategy**\n\n- Use existing system queues (Pending Approval, Pending State, deviation overlays) as **control points**.  \n- Make supervisor responsible for:\n  - Sweeping these queues on RM exit,  \n  - Reassigning and resolving items,  \n  - Enforcing escalation SLAs.  \n- Ensure all advisory context (projections, risk deviations, documents) is attached to client records so the new RM can continue seamlessly.\n\nThis integrated approach minimizes operational, compliance, and client‑experience risk during an abrupt RM handover.', 'resp_0b60d6027530799e006942515e2a40819fb7ca0284f3e615d7', NULL, '{"polled":true,"poll_status":"completed","domainResolution":{"domainId":"wealth_management","strategy":"conversation","confidence":1,"matchedKeywords":[]},"jobId":"job_1765953887233_4k0vth05f","status":"completed","responseId":"resp_0b60d6027530799e006942515e2a40819fb7ca0284f3e615d7","reportFormat":"Custom","mode":"balanced","answeredAt":"2025-12-17T11:23:29.516Z","isCached":true,"cacheId":101,"cachedSimilarity":0.9999997913837482,"cachedMode":"deep"}', '2025-12-17 11:23:30.169934'),

This process can be managed through a dedicated **Handover** screen within the wealth management platform.\n\n1. **Access the Handover Screen:**\n   - Operations users can navigate to the Handover screen via the Operations/Back-office menu.\n   \n2. **Filter Client Set:**\n   - Filter clients by various factors such as current agent, branch, or segment.\n   - Use *Select All* or multi-select checkboxes to choose clients without individual selection.\n   \n3. **Assign New Agent:**\n   - Select the new agent from an available list, ensuring they are eligible and properly credentialed.\n   - Enter a mandatory handover reason (e.g., "Advisor resigned").\n\n4. **Validation and Checklist:**\n   - Review scrutiny checklist items like pending tasks or required documentation.\n   - The checklist allows for remarks to justify incomplete tasks.\n\n5. **Submit for Approval:**\n   - Save and confirm the request, initiating a maker-checker approval process.\n   - A separate checker then reviews and approves the reassignment.\n\n### Controls and Compliance\n\n- **Authorization:** Restricted to operations users with specific entitlements; front-line agents cannot perform bulk reassignments.\n- **Audit Trail:** An audit log records actions taken, providing accountability and transparency [1].\n\n## Bulk Handover via File Upload\n\nFor scenarios involving a very large number of clients, file upload offers an efficient alternative.\n\n1. **Prepare Upload File:**\n   - Create a CSV or Excel file containing client IDs and target agents.\n\n2. **File Upload:**\n   - Access the Batch Upload/Import section and select Client Handover.\n   - Upload the file; the system reassists clients automatically.\n\n3. **Review Upload Results:**\n   - Check the summary for any errors, ensuring all clients are reassigned accurately.\n\n### Audit and Compliance\n\n- **Immediate Processing:** Uploads by authorized users are processed automatically, serving as self-approval.\n- **Logging:** The entire event, including user details and timestamps, is captured in the audit trail to maintain compliance with internal and regulatory standards [2].\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n### Roles and Permissions\n\n- **Operations Role:** Only designated operations or administrative staff with the right entitlements can execute bulk handovers.\n- **Entitlement Controls:** Ensures that client data protection and privacy are upheld by limiting access to sensitive operational functions.\n\n### Validations and Mandatory Checks\n\n- **Pre-Handover Validations:** The platform enforces checks to ensure tasks tied to clients are completed before reassignment.\n- **Mandatory Reasons:** All handovers must include a documented reason, which is stored with the transaction for future reference.\n\n### Impact on Related Workflows\n\n- **Data Consistency:** Ensures real-time updating of client-agent relationships across systems.\n- **Task Carryover:** Ensures all tasks linked to clients transfer to the new agent, preserving workflow continuity.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBulk reassignment facilitates operational efficiency by reducing manual workload and potential errors in client management, ensuring that financial institutions can respond to organizational changes effectively. By employing structured handover processes with built-in controls and comprehensive auditing trails, these systems maintain service quality and regulatory compliance.\n\n## Sources & References\n\n1. *Maybank_Handover and Delegation_V12_CCV10.pdf* — Internal bulk handover process documentation\n2. *SBI_Audit Trail_V10.pdf* — Audit trail design and logging details for client data changes\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis report is based on internal guidelines and best practices and may not cover proprietary methods specific to individual institutions.

('259', '96', 'assistant', 'What risk profiling is and why it matters\n\n- Definition and purpose\n  - Risk profiling is a structured process to assess a client’s willingness and ability to bear investment risk, which determines an appropriate risk profile and, in turn, guides the investment approach. It is based on the client’s risk appetite and yields a score or category used to tailor asset allocation and recommendations [1].\n  - The risk profile and its appetite are configured and maintained within the advisory/application framework, reflecting that each customer has a unique risk tolerance [1].\n\n- How risk profiling is assessed\n  - Assessment is typically conducted via a risk profiling questionnaire, which produces a risk score or category. Some questionnaires are designed to be scorable, while others are non-scorable and used to gauge knowledge of wealth products; both inform the overall risk profile [1].\n  - In practice, the risk profile questionnaire is maintained and linked to the customer’s risk profile, with options to record timelines and history (e.g., risk score history, risk category history) for governance and audit purposes [1].\n  - The process often includes a formal risk profile questionnaire and validation steps, which can generate a “Recommended Risk Profile” and feed into the suitability framework (e.g., SAF) [2].\n\n- Inputs that shape the risk profile\n  - Common inputs include the client’s goals, time horizon, liquidity needs, and broader financial objectives, which feed into the risk assessment and asset-allocation decisions. Time horizon and risk appetite influence the chosen risk profile that governs asset allocation decisions [2].\n\n- How risk profiles map to risk categories\n  - Risk profiling yields a defined risk category or score that corresponds to an expected level of return and volatility, forming a basis for asset allocation decisions and performance expectations. Systems often maintain a history of risk scores and risk categories associated with each profile [1][3].\n  - The risk profile is linked to asset allocation rules (e.g., Asset Allocation details drive how investments are allocated according to the profile) and may be described in risk-profile questionnaires and related documentation [2].\n\n- How profiles drive portfolio construction, client segmentation, and regulatory/compliance\n  - Portfolio construction is guided by the risk profile; asset allocation is maintained for the selected risk profile, ensuring alignment with the client’s risk tolerance and objectives [2].\n  - Risk profiling supports client segmentation by grouping customers according to their profiles and risk appetite, enabling targeted strategies and communications consistent with risk tolerance levels [2].\n  - Regulatory/suitability compliance is embedded in the process through components like the Risk Profile Questionnaire and the Suitability Assessment Form, ensuring that recommendations match the client’s profile and regulatory requirements [2].\n\n- Practical governance aspects (examples across implementations)\n  - Some implementations document maintenance workflows for risk profiling, including risk appetite mapping, risk-profile maintenance, and knowledge checks, underscoring ongoing governance and auditability of risk profiles [1].\n  - The risk profile information is often referenced in downstream screens or journeys (e.g., risk profile prompts during product selection or asset allocation steps), illustrating how profiling interacts with the client journey and decision points [2].\n\nSources\n- 360One_Journey of Assesing Risk_V10_CCV15.pdf [1]\n- HSBC_Journey of Assesing Risk_V1_CCV1.pdf [2]\n- SBI_Journey of Assesing Risk_V1_CCV12.pdf [3]', '371d7441-d4cc-4001-bc5c-98d1775752a0', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["risk profiling","INVESTOR","RM","Order","customer","transaction","Product risk profile","CIF id","securities","warning message"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:customer","dataentity:cif_id","dataentity:securities","dataentity:rm","report:warning_message","compliance:risk_profiling","dataentity:risk_profiling","dataentity:product_risk_profile","aum:risk_profiling","system:rmws","dataentity:transaction","dataentity:order","dataentity:investor","dataentity:warning_message"],"expanded_nodes":48,"expanded_edges":78,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What is risk profiling?","Explain the concept and purpose of risk profiling in wealth management, including its role in assessing client risk tolerance and informing suitability and investment strategy.","Provide a concise, business-focused explanation of risk profiling in wealth management, including definitions, assessment methods (questionnaires, risk scores), inputs (client goals, time horizon, liquidity needs), how results map to risk categories, and how profiles drive portfolio construction, client segmentation, and regulatory/suitability compliance.","[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What is risk profiling? customer","[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What is risk profiling?

('263', '98', 'assistant', 'Asset rebalancing in wealth-management portfolios is guided by a combination of time-based cadences and trigger-based triggers, with frequency being configurable to suit the model and client context.\n\nKey approaches\n- Time-based (periodic) rebalancing: Frequency options are configurable and can include daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly cadences. This allows a disciplined, regular review cycle for asset allocations to align with the target mix [1].\n- Trigger-based rebalancing: Rebalancing can be system-initiated (auto trigger) or advisor-initiated (manual), enabling rebalancing when predefined conditions are met rather than strictly on a calendar basis [1].\n\nHow drift/deviation informs frequency\n- Asset drift is monitored through deviation and exposure views that compare model allocations to actual holdings (model vs. actual vs. selected asset-class allocations). This drift information is used to determine when rebalancing should be considered, as deviations signal misalignment with the target allocation [2].\n\nFactors shaping the recommended frequency\n- Drift thresholds / deviation levels: The need to rebalance is driven by how far actual allocations have deviated from the model targets, as surfaced by deviation/exposure measurements [2].\n- Risk tolerance and client objectives: The chosen cadence and trigger thresholds reflect the client''s risk appetite and stated goals, which influence how aggressively allocations are kept in line with targets [1].\n- Tax and transaction cost considerations: Frequency and trigger selection balance the desire to maintain target allocations with the potential tax consequences and costs of trading [1].\n- Asset-class behavior and platform governance: The behavior of underlying asset classes and the governance/workflow configuration of the platform (e.g., model order approval workflows) influence how and when rebalancing is executed [1], and how deviations are presented to users for decisioning [2].\n\nPractical takeaway\n- Most wealth-management implementations support both time-based cadences and deviation-driven triggers, with the exact frequency and trigger rules configurable in the model/portfolio setup. This allows tailoring to client objectives, risk tolerance, and cost/tax considerations while maintaining appropriate governance and control over rebalancing actions [1][2].\n\nSources\n- [1] EID031 - Model Portfolio_Basket Based Investments.docx\n- [2] SBI_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement - MF V10_SBI_CCV13.pdf', '9d276133-8a5e-4849-8f57-18f6fac66e04', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["Selected Portfolio - Asset Class","Asset Class wise Product Composition","Product Composition – Asset Class","List of Asset Classes","Mutual Fund – View Deviation & Exposure","Portfolio Performance Report","Portfolio View","Mutual Funds","securities","Product Cart"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:asset_class_wise_product_composition","report:mutual_fund_view_deviation_exposure","datastore:product_cart","dataentity:mutual_funds","system:product_cart","dataentity:product_cart","report:selected_pf_asset_class","report:product_composition","dataentity:list_asset_classes","report:pf_view","dataentity:securities","dataentity:product_composition_asset_class","report:product_cart","report:pf_performance_report"],"expanded_nodes":68,"expanded_edges":124,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: How often is asset rebalancing recommended within wealth management portfolios?","What is the recommended frequency for rebalancing client portfolios in wealth management, and what factors determine that frequency?","What is the standard rebalancing frequency for wealth management portfolios, including time-based and trigger-based approaches, and what factors influence this guidance (portfolio drift thresholds, risk tolerance, client objectives, tax and cost considerations, asset-class behavior, and platform governance/workflow implications)?","[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: How often is asset rebalancing recommended within wealth management portfolios?

('265', '101', 'assistant', 'Role of the Risk Profile Questionnaire in Shaping Investment Strategies\n\n- What it is and what it yields\n  - The risk profile questionnaire is designed to gauge an investor’s willingness to take risk and their risk-taking capability, with the outcome being a risk profile assigned to the investor based on their responses. This foundational input drives subsequent investment planning and execution steps [1].\n  - The questionnaire is typically structured into three sections—Financial Profiling, Investment Knowledge Profiling, and Risk Profiling—whose combined data produce a quantified risk score and an accompanying risk profile description (the basis for strategy). This tripartite structure and its outputs are described as the core flow for risk assessment and profiling [2].\n\n- How it informs onboarding and risk-tolerance assessment\n  - Onboarding processes navigate to the risk profile questionnaire when no prior risk profile exists, ensuring that a fresh assessment is obtained before any investment actions are taken. This onboarding flow explicitly links the risk profile to the overall client profile (investor onboarding and risk profiling) [1].\n  - On completion, the risk profile and its score are used to determine the recommended risk profile, which feeds downstream decisions such as asset allocation and model-portfolio mapping. Governance and maintenance steps (risk appetite mapping, questionnaire maintenance) are described as prerequisites in the onboarding flow, illustrating the role of the questionnaire in establishing the investor’s risk framework upfront [3].\n  - The risk profile mechanism is integrated with a broader governance model, including mapping to risk appetites and model portfolios, which provides structured checks before execution. Deviation from risk mappings is governed in the order-placement stage, underscoring lifecycle controls for risk alignment [3].\n\n- How it drives asset allocation and model portfolios\n  - The risk profile emerges as the basis for asset-allocation maintenance and the selection of model portfolios. The literature describes a direct linkage: risk profiles drive the asset-allocation framework, and model portfolios are defined to reflect the risk level associated with each profile. This linkage is central to how investment recommendations are calibrated to risk tolerance [4].\n  - Outputs from the risk profile questionnaire include expected return, standard deviation, risk score, and the corresponding model-asset-allocation guidance. These outputs feed the recommended risk profile screen and the set of funds or assets that constitute the model portfolio for that risk tier [2].\n\n- How it informs product recommendations and suitability determinations\n  - The risk profile informs which products and asset classes are suitable for the investor, with the model-portfolio framework serving as the vehicle for translating risk tolerance into a concrete investment mix. Product risk profiles and the corresponding recommended allocations are part of the model-portfolio maintenance workflow, linking risk assessment to product selection and suitability determinations [4].\n\n- Lifecycle governance and review implications\n  - The risk profile serves as a prerequisite for asset-allocation maintenance and model-portfolio setup, with governance steps such as risk appetite mapping and appropriate approvals embedded in the lifecycle. The process explicitly notes that risk profiling and questionnaire maintenance are prerequisites and that deviation from risk alignment is controlled within the order-placement phase, ensuring ongoing risk governance as part of portfolio construction and execution [3].\n  - The lifecycle includes reassessment capabilities (e.g., reassessing risk profile after completing the questionnaire) to ensure the profile remains aligned with current circumstances and investment goals. This reassessment pathway is documented within client-portal flows, illustrating ongoing risk governance and profile updates [6].\n\n- Practical outcomes for the investor journey\n  - The end-to-end flow ties the risk profile questionnaire to the investor’s journey: onboarding, risk assessment, asset allocation, model portfolio maintenance, order placement, and settlement, with risk-profiling data serving as the anchor for each step. The linkage of risk profile outcomes to asset allocation and model portfolios is repeatedly described across risk-assessment and model-portfolio documents, confirming the central role of the questionnaire in shaping strategy and execution [1][2][4].\n\nSources:\n- SBI_Journey of Assesing Risk_V1_CCV12.pdf [1]\n- 360One_Journey of Assesing Risk_V10_CCV15.pdf [2]\n- SBI_Journey of Defining Maintenances__V10.pdf [3]\n- 360One_Journey of Creating Model Portfolio_V11_CCV13.pdf [4]\n- SBI_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V10_SBI_CCV13.pdf [5]\n- SBI_Journey of Client Portal_V10_CCV15.pdf [6]', '5930a90e-b52a-46a6-b57b-83519edb3f0c', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["risk profiling","INVESTOR","Journey from Assessing Risk","Risk Profile Deviation alert","KYC Compliance information","KYC","PMS application","India Infoline Wealth","Model Portfolio – Order Placement","Mutual Funds"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:kyc","report:risk_profile_deviation_alert","compliance:risk_profiling","system:india_infoline_wealth","dataentity:risk_profiling","compliance:kyc_compliance_info","dataentity:investor","dataentity:mutual_funds","report:model_pf_order_placement","aum:risk_profiling","system:pms_app"],"expanded_nodes":42,"expanded_edges":86,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What is the role of the risk profile questionnaire in shaping client investment strategies?\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn a single JSON object with keys \\"answer\\" and \\"followup_questions\\".\\n- \\"answer\\": markdown string with the full response.\\n- \\"followup_questions\\": array of 3-5 concise, domain-relevant follow-up questions.\\nReturn JSON only.","How does the risk-profile questionnaire influence the design and execution of a client''s investment strategy within our wealth-management workflow, including risk tolerance assessment, objectives, and asset-allocation decisions?","Explain how the risk profile questionnaire feeds into client onboarding and portfolio construction: how responses translate into a quantified risk-tolerance score, defined investment objectives, time horizon, liquidity needs, and any constraints; how these inputs map to asset-allocation models, product recommendations, and suitability determinations; and what governance steps (approvals, reviews) are triggered across the client lifecycle.","[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What is the role of the risk profile questionnaire in shaping client investment strategies?\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn a single JSON object with keys \\"answer\\" and \\"followup_questions\\".\\n- \\"answer\\": markdown string with the full response.\\n- \\"followup_questions\\": array of 3-5 concise, domain-relevant follow-up questions.\\nReturn JSON only.

[1][2][3][5]\n\nFoundational elements\n- Risk profiling and risk appetite mapping guide diversification decisions. The risk-assessment journey defines each client’s risk tolerance, which informs how broadly and deeply to diversify across holdings and asset types. This foundational step ensures that the diversification approach is tailored to the individual client. [1]\n- Model portfolios provide a structured, repeatable framework for diversification. Model Portfolio Maintenance defines and maintains the diversified holdings, and the model is integrated with the portfolio management system to translate the allocation into executable orders. This enables consistent diversification across clients mapped to the same framework. [4]\n\nHow diversification is implemented in practice\n- Asset-class and sector exposure management\n  Diversification is operationalized by capturing and presenting asset-class wise and sector-wise composition for each security in the portfolio. This visibility ensures that the overall portfolio spreads risk across broad asset classes and industry exposures rather than concentrating in a narrow subset. [2]\n- Product selection and portfolio construction\n  The product selection process exposes multiple instruments within a consolidated framework (e.g., mutual funds or other eligible products) that are then combined into a model portfolio. The selection screen enables assembling a diversified basket that reflects the intended allocation across asset classes and sectors, which is subsequently executed through the PMS integration. [4]\n- Monitoring, governance, and rebalancing\n  Diversification is actively maintained through governance-enabled maintenance of model portfolios and automated alerts. Alert rules monitor portfolio performance and diversification integrity (e.g., portfolio rebalancing alerts), triggering reviews or rebalance actions as needed. This ensures that the portfolio remains aligned with the client’s risk profile and evolving market conditions. [5]\n\nEnd-to-end flow supporting diversification\n- Risk profiling feeds into asset allocation and diversification decisions, informing the target allocations and allowable concentration limits. This linkage ensures that diversification is not static but evolves with the client’s risk posture. [1]\n- The model portfolio construct, order placement, and PMS integration enable disciplined execution of a diversified allocation, with product overlays and exposure visibility guiding ongoing adjustments. [4]\n- Asset-class and sector exposure data are surfaced at the product/overlay level to ensure that diversification is measured and managed within the client’s holdings. [2]\n- Alerts and governance mechanisms provide continuous oversight and trigger diversification-related actions (e.g., rebalancing) when required by performance, risk, or policy deviations. [5]\n\nIn summary\nDiversification in wealth management is a systemic, risk-profile-driven discipline that combines risk assessment, model portfolio design, asset-class/sector exposure visibility, disciplined execution through PMS workflows, and continuous monitoring with governance-backed rebalancing. This integrated approach supports spreading risk across a broad set of assets and exposures while staying aligned with each client’s objectives and constraints.

('269', '103', 'assistant', 'Role of the Risk Profile Questionnaire in Shaping Investment Strategies\n\n- What it is and what it yields\n  - The risk profile questionnaire is designed to gauge an investor’s willingness to take risk and their risk-taking capability, with the outcome being a risk profile assigned to the investor based on their responses. This foundational input drives subsequent investment planning and execution steps [1].\n  - The questionnaire is typically structured into three sections—Financial Profiling, Investment Knowledge Profiling, and Risk Profiling—whose combined data produce a quantified risk score and an accompanying risk profile description (the basis for strategy). This tripartite structure and its outputs are described as the core flow for risk assessment and profiling [2].\n\n- How it informs onboarding and risk-tolerance assessment\n  - Onboarding processes navigate to the risk profile questionnaire when no prior risk profile exists, ensuring that a fresh assessment is obtained before any investment actions are taken. This onboarding flow explicitly links the risk profile to the overall client profile (investor onboarding and risk profiling) [1].\n  - On completion, the risk profile and its score are used to determine the recommended risk profile, which feeds downstream decisions such as asset allocation and model-portfolio mapping. Governance and maintenance steps (risk appetite mapping, questionnaire maintenance) are described as prerequisites in the onboarding flow, illustrating the role of the questionnaire in establishing the investor’s risk framework upfront [3].\n  - The risk profile mechanism is integrated with a broader governance model, including mapping to risk appetites and model portfolios, which provides structured checks before execution. Deviation from risk mappings is governed in the order-placement stage, underscoring lifecycle controls for risk alignment [3].\n\n- How it drives asset allocation and model portfolios\n  - The risk profile emerges as the basis for asset-allocation maintenance and the selection of model portfolios. The literature describes a direct linkage: risk profiles drive the asset-allocation framework, and model portfolios are defined to reflect the risk level associated with each profile. This linkage is central to how investment recommendations are calibrated to risk tolerance [4].\n  - Outputs from the risk profile questionnaire include expected return, standard deviation, risk score, and the corresponding model-asset-allocation guidance. These outputs feed the recommended risk profile screen and the set of funds or assets that constitute the model portfolio for that risk tier [2].\n\n- How it informs product recommendations and suitability determinations\n  - The risk profile informs which products and asset classes are suitable for the investor, with the model-portfolio framework serving as the vehicle for translating risk tolerance into a concrete investment mix. Product risk profiles and the corresponding recommended allocations are part of the model-portfolio maintenance workflow, linking risk assessment to product selection and suitability determinations [4].\n\n- Lifecycle governance and review implications\n  - The risk profile serves as a prerequisite for asset-allocation maintenance and model-portfolio setup, with governance steps such as risk appetite mapping and appropriate approvals embedded in the lifecycle. The process explicitly notes that risk profiling and questionnaire maintenance are prerequisites and that deviation from risk alignment is controlled within the order-placement phase, ensuring ongoing risk governance as part of portfolio construction and execution [3].\n  - The lifecycle includes reassessment capabilities (e.g., reassessing risk profile after completing the questionnaire) to ensure the profile remains aligned with current circumstances and investment goals. This reassessment pathway is documented within client-portal flows, illustrating ongoing risk governance and profile updates [6].\n\n- Practical outcomes for the investor journey\n  - The end-to-end flow ties the risk profile questionnaire to the investor’s journey: onboarding, risk assessment, asset allocation, model portfolio maintenance, order placement, and settlement, with risk-profiling data serving as the anchor for each step. The linkage of risk profile outcomes to asset allocation and model portfolios is repeatedly described across risk-assessment and model-portfolio documents, confirming the central role of the questionnaire in shaping strategy and execution [1][2][4].\n\nSources:\n- SBI_Journey of Assesing Risk_V1_CCV12.pdf [1]\n- 360One_Journey of Assesing Risk_V10_CCV15.pdf [2]\n- SBI_Journey of Defining Maintenances__V10.pdf [3]\n- 360One_Journey of Creating Model Portfolio_V11_CCV13.pdf [4]\n- SBI_Journey from Order Placement till Settlement_V10_SBI_CCV13.pdf [5]\n- SBI_Journey of Client Portal_V10_CCV15.pdf [6]', '5930a90e-b52a-46a6-b57b-83519edb3f0c', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["risk profiling","INVESTOR","Journey from Assessing Risk","Risk Profile Deviation alert","KYC Compliance information","KYC","PMS application","India Infoline Wealth","Model Portfolio – Order Placement","Mutual Funds"],"seed_node_ids":["dataentity:kyc","report:risk_profile_deviation_alert","compliance:risk_profiling","system:india_infoline_wealth","dataentity:risk_profiling","compliance:kyc_compliance_info","dataentity:investor","dataentity:mutual_funds","report:model_pf_order_placement","aum:risk_profiling","system:pms_app"],"expanded_nodes":42,"expanded_edges":86,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What is the role of the risk profile questionnaire in shaping client investment strategies?\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn a single JSON object with keys \\"answer\\" and \\"followup_questions\\".\\n- \\"answer\\": markdown string with the full response.\\n- \\"followup_questions\\": array of 3-5 concise, domain-relevant follow-up questions.\\nReturn JSON only.","How does the risk-profile questionnaire influence the design and execution of a client''s investment strategy within our wealth-management workflow, including risk tolerance assessment, objectives, and asset-allocation decisions?","Explain how the risk profile questionnaire feeds into client onboarding and portfolio construction: how responses translate into a quantified risk-tolerance score, defined investment objectives, time horizon, liquidity needs, and any constraints; how these inputs map to asset-allocation models, product recommendations, and suitability determinations; and what governance steps (approvals, reviews) are triggered across the client lifecycle.","[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: What is the role of the risk profile questionnaire in shaping client investment strategies?\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn a single JSON object with keys \\"answer\\" and \\"followup_questions\\".\\n- \\"answer\\": markdown string with the full response.\\n- \\"followup_questions\\": array of 3-5 concise, domain-relevant follow-up questions.\\nReturn JSON only.

Supported fee types / structures\n\nBased on the available documentation, the platform supports the following **revenue and commission-related fee structures**:\n\n1. **Percentage-based trail fees (ongoing commissions)**  \n   * Trail fees are defined as a percentage of assets under management (AUM), typically per scheme and often by category (debt, equity, hybrid etc.).   \n   * Examples include:  \n     - **Perpetual trail fee rate** (ongoing until lot is redeemed, often for SIP/STP transactions).   \n     - **T30 trail fee rate** and **B30 additional trail fee** with scheme- and location-specific percentage rates, subject to conditions like investment amount and investor location.   \n     - **Special trail fee rate** for selected schemes or campaigns.   \n   * These are classic **percentage-of-AUM** fee structures.\n\n2. **Rate-card based percentage brokerage/commission**  \n   * The system maintains **rate cards** for mutual fund commissions/trail fees that can be modified and used for revenue recalculation for prior periods, implying a structured table of percentage-based rates per fund house/scheme.   \n   * Brokerage and trail amounts are then reconciled lot-wise against registrar (RTA/RnTA) files, again as **percentage-based commissions** on each transaction or holding lot. \n\n3. **Positive/negative brokerage for trail and clawback (effective performance/retention adjustment)**  \n   * In reconciliation, **brokerage and clawback** are treated as positive and negative amounts respectively in the same field in RTA files.   \n   * Clawback logic effectively creates a **performance-/behaviour-linked adjustment** (e.g., reversal of previously paid trail if redemption happens within a specified clawback period).  \n\n4. **Location- and time-bound differential trail fees**  \n   * **B30 additional trail fee** is an **incremental percentage trail** applicable only for certain locations (beyond top-30 cities) and within defined investment and time thresholds.   \n   * **T30 trail fees** are the standard trail rates applicable across locations and products, often for a defined number of years, after which the latest rate is used. \n\n> The documents do **not** explicitly describe flat (absolute currency) fees or generic performance-fee formulas (e.g., high-watermark-based incentives for PMS/AIF). The supported and fully specified structures in the available material are **percentage-based trail/brokerage and their clawbacks/adjustments**.\n\n\n### 2. Where fee definitions are configured and managed\n\nThe fee definitions and their lifecycle are distributed across several key configuration and processing points:\n\n#### 2.1. Trail Fee / Rate Card Maintenance (Revenue Desk)\n\n* There is a dedicated **Trail Fee Maintenance** function accessible via the **Revenue Desk**.   \n* Users can:\n  - Maintain **trail fee rates** for different fund houses and schemes (rate card).   \n  - **Create, modify, and delete** trail fee records via specific screens (e.g., “Modify Trail Fee”, “Delete Trail Fee”).   \n  - Submit changes for **Supervisor authorization**, after which the updated rates become effective. \n* The rate card defines, per scheme/fund house (and sometimes per time bucket), the **percentage trail fee** to be applied for revenue computation and reconciliation.  \n\n#### 2.2. Scheme / Security-level Fee Logic\n\n* The **fund house (AMC) and scheme master / security maintenance** store scheme attributes that determine **which fee rules apply**:\n  - Whether a transaction type (Subscription/SIP/STP/Switch) is eligible for a given **trail fee type** (Perpetual, T30, B30, Special).   \n  - For some scenarios (e.g., **Inter Scheme Switch**), schemes can be marked so that **Special trail fees are not computed** for specific transaction types (e.g., Switch-In). This configuration exists as flags under fund house/scheme maintenance. \n* These parameters ensure that, at transaction level, the engine knows **which percentage trail rate to pick** and whether any **additional or special fees** are applicable. \n\n#### 2.3. Trail Fee Computation Engine\n\n* A dedicated **Trail Fee Computation** process calculates:\n  - **Perpetual trail** from SIP/STP transaction date until lot is redeemed.   \n  - **B30 Additional Trail** for eligible locations and only up to one year, subject to investment amount and clawback rules.   \n  - **T30 Trail** for defined tenors (e.g., maximum 5 years, after which the latest rate applies).   \n  - **Special trail** for designated campaigns or schemes (excluding certain switch scenarios as configured). \n* The engine reads the **rate card / trail fee tables** and applies them at **lot level**, considering transaction type, date, scheme, location, and amount. \n\n#### 2.4. Reconciliation with RTA / Reverse Feeds\n\n* The **Trail Fee Reconciliation** component reconciles **lot-wise brokerage information** from the system with **RTA reverse feed files**.   \n* Matching rules typically include AMC code, scheme code, transaction reference number, and brokerage/clawback amounts.   \n* In RTA files, **brokerage and clawback** are represented as positive and negative amounts in the same field; the system interprets these as **trail fee and reversals**.   \n* This reconciliation step validates that **configured fee rates and computed revenue** match external records, and it stores the final, reconciled fee amounts at lot/transaction level. \n\n#### 2.5. Revenue Recalculation on Rate Card Changes\n\n* When **rate card (trail fee) definitions are modified**, the system allows **revenue recalculation for previous months** from the Revenue Desk, ensuring historical fee income aligns with updated rates and business rules. \n\n\n### 3. How and where fees are applied in journeys and data\n\n1. **At transaction / lot level**  \n   * For each subscription, SIP/STP, switch, or other eligible transaction, the system generates **lots** that are used as the base for trail fee computation over time.  \n\n2. **At customer and AUM reporting level**  \n   * Computed and reconciled trail fees feed into **revenue and AUM dashboards/reports**, with the ability to adjust when rate cards are changed. \n\n3. **At fund house / scheme governance level**  \n   * Fund house and scheme parameters (e.g., eligibility for special fees, B30/T30 applicability, clawback rules) are maintained centrally and govern where and how fee percentages are applied. \n\n\n### 4. Summary\n\n* The platform **primarily supports percentage-based commission/trail fee structures**, including standard trail, location-based additional trail (B30), special trail, and corresponding clawbacks.    \n* Fee definitions are maintained in a **Trail Fee / rate card maintenance module under the Revenue Desk**, with creation, modification, deletion and supervisor authorization workflows.    \n* Scheme and fund-house level maintenance captures **eligibility flags and exclusions**, which govern which fee rules apply to which products and transaction types.   \n* Fees are computed by a **trail fee computation engine** and validated via **trail fee reconciliation** against RTA reverse feeds, capturing brokerage and clawback at lot level.  \n* The documentation available does **not explicitly define flat-fee or generic performance-fee (e.g., profit-sharing) structures**; the implemented and detailed models are all **percentage-based**.\n\n\n#### Sources\n\n1.

('275', '105', 'assistant', 'Audit events that Cement Immutable Records Across Orders, Payments, and Access\n\n- Access and authentication events (Login and access-control changes): These are captured in the audit trail to provide a tamper-evident history of who accessed the system and when, including the user who performed actions and the timing of those actions, as well as changes to access rights. This is explicitly described in audit-trail documentation, including the login workflow and the general audit-trail framework for access-domain activities. [1] [2]\n\n- Order and payment-related transactional events: The audit trail framework is described as recording actions on key business entities within transactional domains (e.g., PMX-related entities). While specific enumerations vary by module, the PMX audit-trail documentation demonstrates that actions performed on critical transactional entities are logged chronologically, providing an immutable record of changes and actions taken in those domains. Examples of audited PMX entities include Asset Allocation, Security Portfolio, Model Portfolio, Security, and other core items that collectively cover transactional actions and order/payments-related changes within the platform. [4]\n\n- Data fields captured for each audited event (immutability evidence): For every audited entry, the following data are captured to establish a tamper-evident, versioned history: the entity’s unique id, a description of the entity, Maker ID (who created/modified), Maker Date (when created/modified), Auth ID (who authorized), Auth Date (when authorized/rejected), Status (e.g., Unauthorized, Authorized, Rejected, Modified), and Revision ID (a unique revision identifier). These fields underpin immutability and traceability across all audited events. [1]\n\n- Access to audit trails (retrieval and query): The audit-trail UI supports filtering by From Date, To Date, Entity Type, and Entity, enabling users to locate and review audited events across orders, payments, and access-related actions within the defined date windows. This is described across multiple audit-trail documentation sets, illustrating consistent capabilities to query historical audit data by date ranges and entity types. [2] [3]\n\n- Chronological storage of audit data: Audit trail entries are stored chronologically, ensuring a sequential, tamper-evident history of actions. This characteristic is demonstrated in PMX-focused audit-trail documentation, which states that audit information is kept in chronological order and captured for actions performed by users.

('277', '105', 'assistant', '## 1. Frequency and Triggers of Audit Trail Reviews\n\nWealth-management platforms typically maintain continuous audit trails for all critical user and system actions (add, modify, delete, authorize, reject) on key entities and configurations. The underlying product documentation describes *how* actions are logged and made queryable (e.g., via an "Audit Trail" screen with date and entity filters), but the *exact* day-by-day review frequency is determined by each institution’s internal policies and regulatory environment rather than hard‑coded in the product.\n\nA standard, defensible model for reviews is:\n\n- **Near real‑time / daily monitoring**\n  - Automated alerting from security monitoring or log-management tooling (e.g., SIEM) for high‑risk events (privileged access changes, failed logins, bulk data export, configuration changes).\n  - Daily spot checks by operations or IT security for critical business services (e.g., order processing, portfolio updates, client profile changes), leveraging the audit trail search and export capabilities.\n\n- **Formal periodic reviews**\n  - **Weekly:** Targeted sampling of audit entries for high‑risk processes (e.g., onboarding/KYC changes, portfolio model changes, order authorization overrides) to confirm control effectiveness.\n  - **Monthly or Quarterly:** Structured, documented reviews of audit trails covering broader scope (CRM, portfolio management, operations office) as part of compliance and ITGC (IT General Controls) programs, with evidence retained.\n\n- **Event‑driven reviews**\n  - In response to incidents, complaints, or regulatory queries, the audit trail is queried for the relevant date range, entity, and user(s); reports are exported (e.g., XLS) and attached to investigation records.\n\nBecause the product provides flexible query and export functions rather than a fixed schedule, the *platform-agnostic* answer is: **audit trails are available for continuous access; institutions typically configure a combination of daily automated monitoring plus weekly–quarterly formal reviews, aligned to their risk appetite and regulatory obligations.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Scope of Each Review\n\nThe audit trail implementations capture user actions chronologically across a catalogue of entities such as customer data, asset allocation, security and model portfolios, alerts, broadcasts, and product configurations.\n\nA standard scope model is:\n\n1. **Core client and portfolio data**\n   - Customer profile and KYC attributes.\n   - Asset allocation and sub‑asset allocation changes.\n   - Security and model portfolio configuration (e.g., risk profile, benchmarks, composition).\n\n2. **Transactional and order-related actions**\n   - Order creation, modification, cancellation, authorization, and rejection.\n   - Changes to workflow rules or approval hierarchies where logged.\n\n3. **Supervisory and configuration events**\n   - Changes to alerts, broadcasting, disclaimers, glossaries, market outlooks, and sub‑product definitions.\n   - Role/entitlement assignments where these are captured in the platform or integrated IAM system.\n\n4. **Access and operational events**\n   - User login activity and application access points.\n   - Administrative or configuration changes in key operational modules (e.g., operations office, CRM).\n\nDuring a review, the reviewer typically filters by:\n- Date/period (From–To).\n- Entity type and specific entity instance.\n- User ID or role when investigating specific actors.\nThese capabilities are explicitly supported in the audit trail UI for various deployments.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Roles and Responsibilities\n\nThe documentation describes different functional modules (e.g., CRM, PMX, Operations Office) with audit trails accessible under appropriate menus, implying segregation between front‑office, operations, and supervisory users.\n\nA standard ownership model is:\n\n- **Control owner / first line of defence**\n  - Operations teams (e.g., operations office, portfolio operations) review audit logs related to day‑to‑day processing (order flows, cash movements, reconciliations) and front‑office data updates.\n\n- **Compliance / risk management (second line)**\n  - Designs the formal review schedule, sampling methodology, and reporting templates.\n  - Performs independent periodic reviews of selected populations (e.g., high‑risk clients, sensitive fields) using audit trail exports as evidence.\n\n- **IT security / platform team**\n  - Ensures audit logging is enabled and complete for all critical services and that logs are securely stored and accessible to authorized reviewers.\n  - Monitors security events, suspicious access patterns, and system‑level changes, often via a central log or SIEM solution integrated with the platform’s event-driven architecture.\n\n- **Internal audit (third line)**\n  - Performs independent testing of audit trail coverage and effectiveness of the review process, using the same UI and exports as the business and compliance teams plus underlying technical logs where needed.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Criteria for Compliance and Data Accuracy\n\nWhile the product documentation focuses on *what is logged* (action types, old vs new values, user, timestamps, status changes), institutions typically use that data to test controls against criteria such as:\n\n1. **Authorization and segregation of duties**\n   - Verification that sensitive actions (e.g., client risk profile change, large order placement, model portfolio changes) are performed by authorized roles and, where required, duly approved by a separate approver.\n   - Confirmation that no user performs incompatible actions end‑to‑end without required oversight.\n\n2. **Data accuracy and integrity**\n   - For modifications, confirming the *old value* and *new value* are consistent with supporting documentation or upstream approvals (e.g., client instructions, investment committee decisions).\n   - Ensuring no unexplained or repeated reversals/overrides that might indicate data quality or control issues.\n\n3. **Completeness and chronological ordering**\n   - Ensuring each key lifecycle event (add, modify, delete, authorize, reject) appears in the log with a unique audit ID and timestamp.\n   - Checking there are no unexplained gaps for specific periods, users, or entities.\n\n4. **Policy and regulatory alignment**\n   - Testing sample events against internal policies (e.g., turnaround times, required approvals, documentation standards) and regulatory requirements around record‑keeping and suitability.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Remediation and Escalation\n\nTypical steps when exceptions or anomalies are identified during an audit trail review are:\n\n1. **Classification of findings**\n   - Misaligned or missing approvals, unexplained data changes, access by unauthorized roles, or suspicious frequency of changes.\n\n2. **Remediation actions**\n   - Correct the underlying data, where permissible, and record the correction in the audit trail (which will itself appear as a new modification entry with old and new values).\n   - Where configuration or entitlement issues are discovered, update roles and access controls and document the change.\n\n3. **Escalation**\n   - Operational issues: escalated to line management and operations leadership.\n   - Compliance or conduct concerns: escalated to compliance and, where needed, HR or legal.\n   - Potential security incidents: escalated through the incident management process led by IT security.\n\n4. **Root cause and control enhancement**\n   - Use the detailed chronology of events (user, timestamp, sequence) to reconstruct what happened and enhance controls (e.g., stricter approval rules, monitoring rules, or user training).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Regulatory, Retention, and Evidence Handling\n\nThe platform’s technical architecture supports strong auditability and event sourcing, including replay capability and auditability for key transactional domains. This enables institutions to align with regulatory requirements for:\n\n- **Retention of records**\n  - Maintaining complete audit logs for periods mandated by local regulations (often multiple years for client and transaction records in wealth management).\n  - Using dedicated schemas and access controls so audit data is preserved and tamper‑evident.\n\n- **Evidence capture**\n  - Reviewers can export audit trail records (e.g., via "Save as XLS" or similar functionality) for specific entities and periods; these exports are then stored with the compliance working papers or incident records.\n  - Documentation typically includes the selection parameters (date range, entity, user filter), rationale for the sample, review notes, and conclusions.\n\n- **Traceability and replay**\n  - Because each change is logged with before/after values and timestamps for key business entities, reviewers and auditors can reconstruct the evolution of a client record or portfolio over time, supporting suitability reviews and dispute resolution.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Reporting and Tracking of Outcomes\n\nInstitutions usually layer a governance process on top of the product capabilities. A standard pattern is:\n\n1. **Structured review records**\n   - For each scheduled review, maintain a checklist or template capturing: period covered, scope (modules/entities), sampling approach, reviewers, and sign‑offs.\n   - Attach exported audit trail files and any supporting evidence (e.g., approval emails, tickets).\n\n2. **Issue logs and dashboards**\n   - Document exceptions in an issues register with owner, due date, and remediation steps.\n   - Aggregate key metrics (e.g., number of exceptions per period, by entity type or business unit) into compliance or operational risk dashboards.\n\n3. **Management and board reporting**\n   - Periodically (e.g., quarterly), summarise audit trail review outcomes, significant incidents, remediation status, and trends to senior management and risk committees.\n\n4. **Continuous improvement feedback loop**\n   - Use findings to refine alert rules, access controls, and training programs.\n   - Where needed, extend the scope of audit logging to additional entities or fields as supported by the platform’s event‑driven, microservices architecture.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Synthesised View on "How Often" Reviews Occur\n\nPutting this together in a platform-agnostic way, aligned with how the wealth platform structures audit trails and access to them:\n\n- **Audit logs are created automatically and continuously** for all covered user actions and status changes across CRM, portfolio management, operations and related modules.\n- **There is no single hard-coded frequency in the product**; rather, institutions configure a layered operating model:\n  - Continuous/near real‑time monitoring for critical and security‑relevant events.\n  - Daily or intra‑day spot‑checks for high‑risk operations where appropriate.\n  - Formal, documented reviews on a **weekly to quarterly cadence** depending on risk and regulatory requirements.\n- Review outcomes are **documented, evidenced with exported audit trail records, linked to remediation actions, and reported into the broader compliance and risk governance framework.**\n\n\n### Practical Next Step\n\nFor a given implementation, you would typically:\n1. Map critical entities and events (based on the audit trail coverage in each module).\n2. Define a risk‑based schedule (daily monitoring + weekly/monthly/quarterly formal checks).\n3. Assign ownership to operations, compliance, and IT security, with clear escalation paths.\n4. Standardise templates for evidence capture, issue logging, and management reporting.\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n\n- [1] 360One_Audit Trail_V10_CCV10.pdf\n- [2] SBI_Audit Trail_V10.pdf\n- [3] Jio Blackrock_Audit Trail_V10_CCV12.pdf\n- [4] HSBC_Audit Trail_V10_CCV10.pdf\n- [5] Dhofar Tech - Wealth.pdf', 'b748088d-8c29-4200-bba3-f98577f7bd26', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"balanced","model":"gpt-5.1","seed_node_names":[],"seed_node_ids":[],"expanded_nodes":0,"expanded_edges":0,"kg_guided_queries":["Previous context ID: b748088d-8c29-4200-bba3-f98577f7bd26\\n\\nQuestion: [Context-Aware Follow-up Question with Focus Directives]\\n\\nPrevious conversation history is provided for context.

('279', '106', 'assistant', 'Impact of RTA data feeds and the BSE STAR gateway on order routing and confirmations\n\nRouting and identification flow\n- When an order is placed in the wealth OMS, it is prepared for routing through an external processor (BSE STAR) for execution, which establishes the first external routing hop in the journey. This external processor provides an external order number that ties the OMS-side order to the actual market-side instruction. This external order number is generated by the external processor (BSE STAR) and is visible in the order view, linking OMS-managed wealth orders to STAR-processed trades [2].\n  - This external linkage is crucial for downstream visibility and reconciliation, as STAR represents the gateway to the exchange/clearing ecosystem and its generated reference is used in subsequent trade lifecycle events [2].\n- The OMS-to-STAR routing is followed by STAR delivering execution results to the RTA feed pipeline, which then becomes the primary conduit for clearing and settlement data via RTA data feeds. The bridge between the wealth order and the RTA transaction is the User Transaction Number; the same value is carried from outbound (wealth order) to inbound (RTA transaction) files (and the corresponding inbound/outbound references like USRTRXNO or inward numbers) to maintain end-to-end traceability of the order through its lifecycle [1].\n  - Inbound and outbound RTA files use the User Transaction Number as the connector, enabling the OMS to correlate STAR-executed trades with RTA-reported trades (and ultimately with the wealth order) for status updates and settlements [1].\n\nData exchanges and data mapping\n- RTA data feeds provide the authoritative linkage for order lifecycle events (Authorized, Contracted, Settled, Reversed) and reconciliations. Reconciliation can involve three types of processes (Transactions, AUM, Trail Fee), with a defined three-step approach (define rule, threshold, and matching) to resolve discrepancies between internal records and RTA statements [1].\n- Key identifiers used across the flow include:\n  - User Transaction Number: connector between wealth orders and RTA transactions, carried in outbound and inbound RTA files [1].\n  - External Order Number: generated by BSE STAR and associated with the externally routed order; this identifier is carried in STAR’s communications and is visible to stakeholders when tracking the trade [2].\n  - Payment references (paymentrefno): included in the model/order records and visible in the STAR/RTA flow (as part of the model/order details) to support payment reconciliation and traceability [2].\n- Data mapping artifacts referenced in the flow include the linkage between STAR’s external identifiers and RTA data, enabling consistent traceability from order capture to settlement. The presence of payment reference fields in the STAR/Order flow is demonstrated in the external-order flow views, illustrating how payment references are surfaced as part of order-level data [2].\n\nConfirmation generation and delivery\n- Post-execution, confirmations flow back through the system, with notifications generated upon settlement and rejection events. The end-to-end confirmation and notification lifecycle is described in practice journeys where settlement-related emails/SMS are sent to customers when trades settle or when orders are rejected, indicating that confirmations are delivered via system-generated messages to the customer’s registered channels [3].\n- The settlement step in the flow updates customer holdings and order statuses (from Contracted to Settled) after receiving the trade file from the RTA. This confirms that the actual trade has settled and the associated holdings need to reflect the new state [3].\n- For partial confirmations (where only a portion of the RTA-confirmed quantity is matched), the system can modify the existing wealth order (Modified Order) or generate a new order (New Order) with the residual amount/units and appropriate status (Contracted or Rejected). This mechanism ensures the customer and the book reflect partial confirmations accurately; the reconciliation workflow governs these adjustments [1].\n\nRouting logic and destination mapping\n- The routing model follows a pattern where the wealth OMS delegates execution to STAR; STAR’s response (including external order number and trade status) is then reconciled against RTA-provided results. The external order number acts as the durable reference across OMS, STAR, and RTA for tracking and reconciliation, while the User Transaction Number ensures linkage back to the internal wealth order and its origins [2][1].\n- The Order Book and related transaction records are updated based on reconciliation outcomes, with statuses progressing through Authorized → Contracted → Settled, and appropriate handling for reversals or partial confirmations per documented flows [1].\n\nConfirmation delivery and user notification\n- Settlement communications (emails/SMS) are part of the customer-facing confirmations, with templates and notice timing tied to settlement events. Email matrices show that settlement notices are sent at settlement, while rejections trigger separate communications; these are generated by the system as part of the post-settlement or post-rejection workflow [3].\n- The actual confirmations delivered to customers reflect the outcome of the settlement process, including the transaction details, order identifiers, and the settlement date, ensuring customers have timely and verifiable trade confirmations [3].\n\nReconciliation, exceptions, and compliance considerations\n- Reconciliation is a structured process that ensures internal records (OMS, holdings, transaction master) align with RTA statements. The process includes rule-definition, threshold-setting, and matching of records, with multiple reconciliation outcomes (e.g., fully matched, differential matched, accepted, or manual adjustment) that drive subsequent order-status updates [1].\n- Partial confirmation scenarios are explicitly handled via reconciliation, allowing manual acceptance to adjust an existing order or create a new one to reflect RTA-provided quantities. This mechanism preserves accurate position and P&L integrity while aligning the system state with market reality [9].\n- Legal/regulatory and audit considerations are embedded in the reconciliation and settlement processes, ensuring traceability of actions, proper status changes, and accurate delivery of confirmations to investors; the lifecycle is designed to support auditability and regulatory reporting needs (e.g., settlement timing, partial confirmations, and reversal handling) [1][3].', '9b098cc5-09eb-4f5e-98ac-01b18ba468a9', NULL, '{"v2_workflow":true,"mode":"concise","model":"gpt-5-nano","seed_node_names":["RTA","RTA Transaction File","Common RTA Feed file","RTA REF NO.","Field 141"],"seed_node_ids":["system:rta","dataentity:field_141","dataentity:transaction","dataentity:rta_ref_no","datastore:rta_transaction_file","dataentity:common_rta_feed_file","compliance:rta"],"expanded_nodes":69,"expanded_edges":165,"kg_guided_queries":["[Focused Response Directive]\\n\\nPlease follow these instructions when answering:\\n• Answer ONLY the specific question asked - be precise and direct\\n• Include ONLY information that is immediately relevant to this specific question\\n• Exclude tangential details, background context, or loosely related information\\n• Be concise while remaining comprehensive on the core topic\\n• Prioritize clarity and relevance over exhaustive coverage\\n\\nUser''s Question: How do RTA/BSE STAR integrations shape order routing and confirmations?\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn a single JSON object with keys \\"answer\\" and \\"followup_questions\\".\\n- \\"answer\\": markdown string with the full response.\\n- \\"followup_questions\\": array of 3-5 concise, domain-relevant follow-up questions.\\nReturn JSON only.","How do RTA data feeds and BSE STAR integrations influence our order routing decisions and the generation/delivery of trade confirmations within the wealth-management trading workflow?","Describe in detail how integrating Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) data feeds with the BSE STAR gateway affects end-to-end order routing and confirmation processes.

('281', '107', 'assistant', '# Automated generation of target leads from defined customer criteria\n\n## Overview\n- Lead generation is achieved by filtering existing customers through rule-based criteria (lead rules) to produce a target list for campaigns or outreach. This capability is described in lead list management workflows, including automatic lead generation and the ability to generate lists from defined rules [1].\n\n## Data sources to power lead generation\n- Primary source: the set of existing customers in the wealth management system, from which leads are filtered according to rules [2].\n- Customer risk context: risk profile questionnaire data and the related risk-questionnaire maintenance/context inform how customers can be segmented or prioritized within lead rules [3].\n\n## Defining the criteria (lead rules)\n- Create and configure lead rules that define filter criteria to identify potential targets from the existing customer base. Lead rules can be added, viewed, modified, and used to generate lists (leading to campaign targeting) [2].\n- Rule definitions typically encapsulate the target attributes (e.g., risk tier, asset metrics, location, and other customer attributes) and can be adjusted over time to refine targeting [2].\n\n## Scoring, deduplication, and list management\n- Lead-rule workflows support management actions such as viewing, adding, modifying, and generating lists; advanced workflows may include merging lists to consolidate duplicates or complementary segments (deduplication/merging behavior is indicated by lead-list management capabilities) [2].\n\n## Export and integration with CRM/marketing tools\n- Generated lead lists can be used to drive campaigns and other CRM/marketing activities, enabling export or direct use within campaign workflows and related tools [3].\n\n## Typical workflow (high level)\n1) Define lead criteria as a lead rule (e.g., risk profile band, AUM thresholds, geography, demographics, engagement signals). [2]  \n2) Save and configure the rule, then run Generate List to produce the target-lead set from existing customers. [2]  \n3) Review, adjust, and (if needed) merge/deduplicate multiple lead lists to ensure a clean target set. [2]  \n4) Export the resulting lead list to CRM/marketing tools or use it to drive a campaign in the platform. [3]\n\n## Governance and approvals\n- Changes to lead rules themselves may be governed by standard controls in the platform environment, with downstream approvals managed via the same governance processes that manage risk-profile and questionnaire configurations in related journeys.

Handover Context\n\nWhen an RM exits abruptly, the platform’s **Handover** function remaps all clients and pipeline items to a new RM or supervisor. This avoids “ownerless” clients but does **not** by itself resolve in‑flight workflows.\n\nThe continuity strategy must therefore explicitly manage the interaction of these four concurrent workflows:\n\n1. Validations & Warnings (risk controls)  \n2. Supervisor Approval process  \n3. Performance Projection usage  \n4. Mutual Fund / Product Cart order workflow  \n\nand identify where these can collide to create:\n\n- **Process deadlocks** (items stuck with no actor able to move them), and  \n- **Supervisor visibility gaps** (items that exist but are hard to see or interpret).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Workflow 1 – Validations & Warnings\n\n**System logic**\n\n- **Soft stops**  \n  - Trigger warning pop‑ups (e.g., product risk slightly above client risk profile).  \n  - RM can override with justification; system logs deviation.  \n  - On submission, order is routed for higher approval (e.g., Circle/Zonal head, then Supervisor).\n\n- **Hard stops**  \n  - Trigger when a critical rule is breached (e.g., missing mandatory data, product far outside risk profile).  \n  - System **blocks** transaction until corrected.  \n  - Hard‑stop and soft‑stop items are listed in the **Product Cart deviation overlay**.\n\n**Collision / Deadlock risks during handover**\n\n- **Deadlock 1 – Unresolved hard stops**  \n  - Orders with hard‑stop issues created by the outgoing RM remain blocked.  \n  - If no one takes ownership to correct data or remove the product, the order is stuck indefinitely.\n\n- **Deadlock 2 – Soft‑stop overrides with no follow‑through**  \n  - Outgoing RM may have accepted warnings and submitted orders that still require higher‑level approval.  \n  - If these are not visible or reviewed, risk‑deviant orders may sit in limbo.\n\n**Supervisor visibility gaps**\n\n- Deviations are visible at **order level** (Product Cart overlay), but:  \n  - There is no inherent “RM has left” flag on those deviations.  \n  - If the supervisor only looks at approvals by RM name, they may miss risk‑deviant orders tied to a now‑inactive RM.\n\n**Continuity controls**\n\n- **Immediate sweep** after RM exit:\n  - Query all orders with:\n    - Hard‑stop deviations outstanding, and  \n    - Soft‑stop deviations accepted but still pending approval.\n- **Reassignment rule**:\n  - New RM or operations user must:\n    - Complete missing data/documents to clear hard stops, or  \n    - Remove non‑compliant products and re‑discuss with client.\n- **Supervisor check**:\n  - Supervisor re‑reviews all soft‑stop overrides from the outgoing RM before approval.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Workflow 2 – Supervisor Approval Process\n\n**System logic**\n\n- Orders submitted by RMs go to **“Pending Approval”**.  \n- Visible in **Supervisor Approval screen**:  \n  - Search by Order No., Scheme/Security, Customer Name.  \n  - Filter by Transaction Type and **RM Name**.  \n- Orders remain in the queue even if the originating RM becomes inactive.\n\n**Collision / Deadlock risks during handover**\n\n- **Deadlock 3 – Approvals stuck due to reliance on RM filter**  \n  - If the outgoing RM’s profile is disabled, filtering by RM name may no longer be reliable.  \n  - Pending approvals still exist but may not be surfaced if the supervisor relies only on that filter.\n\n- **Deadlock 4 – Multi‑level approvals with absent approver**  \n  - Orders escalated to intermediate approvers (e.g., Circle/Zonal head) can stall if that approver is unavailable and no escalation rule is applied.\n\n**Supervisor visibility gaps**\n\n- Pending orders are visible, but:\n  - They may be “orphaned” conceptually (no active RM to provide context).  \n  - There is no automatic consolidation of “all pending items from RM X who has left” unless the supervisor runs targeted queries.\n\n**Continuity controls**\n\n- **Standard operating step on RM exit**:\n  - Supervisor runs a **pending approvals report** filtered by:\n    - Outgoing RM ID (if still available), and  \n    - Client IDs reassigned to the new RM.\n- **Escalation SLA**:\n  - Define time‑based rules:\n    - If an order remains in “Pending Approval” beyond X hours/days, it escalates to the next authority.  \n- **No re‑entry rule**:\n  - Orders already submitted by the outgoing RM are **not re‑captured**; they are reviewed and approved/rejected as is, with the new RM informed of context.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Workflow 3 – Performance Projection\n\n**System logic**\n\n- Performance Projection is an **analytical tool**:\n  - Simulates future performance under different scenarios.  \n  - Does not create or hold transactional state by itself.  \n  - Outputs (reports, illustrations) may be used in client discussions.\n\n**Collision / Deadlock risks**\n\n- No technical deadlock: projections do not block or gate orders.  \n- **Risk is advisory continuity**, not process blockage:\n  - Client may have seen a specific projection or strategy from the outgoing RM that is not documented.\n\n**Supervisor visibility gaps**\n\n- If projections or proposals are not attached to the client record:\n  - New RM and supervisor may not know what was shown or promised.  \n  - This can lead to inconsistent advice or client confusion.\n\n**Continuity controls**\n\n- **Documentation rule**:\n  - Any projection used in a client proposal should be:\n    - Saved/attached to the client record, or  \n    - Summarized in client notes.\n- **Onboarding brief**:\n  - Supervisor ensures new RM:\n    - Re‑runs key projections for active opportunities, and  \n    - Aligns recommendations with what the client has already seen.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Workflow 4 – Mutual Funds & Product Cart\n\n**System logic**\n\n- RM builds orders in **Product Cart**:\n  - Product selection, validations, documentation checks, client OTP (if applicable), then submission.  \n- System supports **“Order(s) in Pending State”**:\n  - Partially completed orders can be saved and resumed.  \n- Certain transaction types require **mandatory document upload** before submission.\n\n**Collision / Deadlock risks during handover**\n\n- **Deadlock 5 – Orders in Pending State with no owner**  \n  - Outgoing RM leaves with partially completed orders saved but not submitted.  \n  - If not reassigned/reviewed, these instructions remain indefinitely in pending state.\n\n- **Deadlock 6 – Mandatory documents not uploaded**  \n  - Orders that require a document (e.g., physical mode redemption/switch) cannot be submitted without upload.  \n  - If the outgoing RM had not obtained/uploaded the document, the order is blocked.\n\n- **Deadlock 7 – Expired or incomplete client authentication (OTP)**  \n  - If OTP was initiated but not completed before RM exit, the transaction attempt expires.  \n  - No one triggers a fresh OTP; the order never progresses.\n\n**Supervisor visibility gaps**\n\n- Pending orders are tied to:\n  - Client ID and (original) RM ID.  \n- Without a targeted review of **“Order(s) in Pending State)”** for the outgoing RM’s clients, the supervisor may not see:\n  - Draft orders,  \n  - Orders awaiting documents, or  \n  - Orders awaiting client action.\n\n**Continuity controls**\n\n- **Pending bucket sweep**:\n  - On RM exit, operations/supervisor:\n    - Extract all “Order(s) in Pending State” for that RM’s clients.  \n    - Reassign to the new RM.\n- **Action rules** for each pending order:\n  - New RM must:\n    - Confirm with client whether to proceed, modify, or cancel.  \n    - Obtain and upload any mandatory documents.  \n    - Re‑initiate OTP or other client authentication as needed.\n- **Supervisor oversight**:\n  - Supervisor reviews Product Cart deviation overlays for:\n    - Missing documents,  \n    - Hard/soft stops,  \n    - Any “document upload is mandatory” flags.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross‑Workflow Collision Analysis\n\nThe four workflows can overlap on the same order or client. Key collision patterns:\n\n1. **Pending Cart + Validations + Approvals**  \n   - Order in Product Cart with:\n     - Hard‑stop deviation unresolved, and  \n     - Not yet submitted for approval.  \n   - If RM leaves, order is stuck in Pending State with no path to approval.  \n   - **Mitigation**: Pending bucket sweep + new RM resolves deviations, then submits for approval.\n\n2. **Soft‑stop Override + Supervisor Approval + RM Exit**  \n   - Outgoing RM overrides a soft stop and submits.  \n   - Order is in supervisor queue with risk deviation.  \n   - If not explicitly reviewed, it may age in the queue.  \n   - **Mitigation**: Supervisor runs targeted report of all pending approvals with deviations from outgoing RM; applies escalation SLA.\n\n3. **Projection‑Driven Proposal + Draft Order**  \n   - RM shows client a projection, starts building a corresponding MF order, saves it, then exits.  \n   - New RM sees only a draft order with no context.  \n   - **Mitigation**: Require projection/proposal notes attached to client record; supervisor briefs new RM on strategy before order completion.\n\n4. **Mandatory Document + Multi‑Level Approval**  \n   - Order requires document upload and higher‑level approval.  \n   - Document not uploaded; RM exits; intermediate approver unavailable.  \n   - **Mitigation**: New RM/ops obtains document; escalation SLA ensures higher authority can approve if intermediate approver is absent.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Supervisor‑Centric Continuity Playbook\n\n**A. Immediate actions on RM exit**\n\n1. **Client & pipeline reassignment**\n   - Execute Handover to assign all clients to new RM/supervisor.\n\n2. **Queue sweeps**\n   - Supervisor/ops to extract:\n     - All **Pending Approval** orders created by outgoing RM.  \n     - All **Order(s) in Pending State)** for outgoing RM’s clients.  \n     - All orders with **hard/soft‑stop deviations** linked to those clients.\n\n3. **Visibility checks**\n   - Use multiple search keys:\n     - Client ID, Order No., Scheme/Security, not just RM name (in case RM profile is disabled).\n\n**B. Deadlock resolution rules**\n\n- **Hard stops**:  \n  - Must be cleared by new RM/ops (data/documents) or product removed.  \n- **Soft stops**:  \n  - Supervisor re‑validates risk acceptance; may request new RM to reconfirm with client.  \n- **Pending approvals**:  \n  - Apply escalation SLA if intermediate approver is unavailable.  \n- **Pending cart orders**:  \n  - New RM contacts client to confirm intent; either complete, modify, or cancel.\n\n**C. Governance & audit**\n\n- **Off‑boarding checklist for RM**:\n  - Confirm:\n    - All pending orders identified and reassigned.  \n    - All key client proposals/projections documented in client records.\n\n- **On‑boarding checklist for new RM**:\n  - Review:\n    - List of pending approvals and pending cart orders.  \n    - Deviations and documents outstanding.  \n    - Client notes and projection reports.\n\n- **Audit trail**:\n  - Use system logs to verify:\n    - Who reassigned orders,  \n    - Who overrode deviations,  \n    - Who approved or cancelled pending items during the handover window.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Summary of Deadlocks & Visibility Gaps\n\n**Potential Process Deadlocks**\n\n1. Orders blocked by **unresolved hard stops**.  \n2. **Pending approvals** tied to an inactive RM or unavailable approver.  \n3. **Pending cart orders** with no active owner.  \n4. Orders requiring **mandatory documents** that were never obtained.  \n5. Transactions with **expired OTP/authentication** not retriggered.\n\n**Potential Supervisor Visibility Gaps**\n\n1. Reliance on **RM‑name filters** when RM profile is disabled.  \n2. Lack of consolidated view of:\n   - All **pending approvals**,  \n   - All **pending cart orders**,  \n   - All **deviation‑bearing orders** for the outgoing RM’s clients.  \n3. Missing documentation of **projections/proposals**, leading to advisory discontinuity.\n\n**Core Strategy**\n\n- Use existing system queues (Pending Approval, Pending State, deviation overlays) as **control points**.  \n- Make supervisor responsible for:\n  - Sweeping these queues on RM exit,  \n  - Reassigning and resolving items,  \n  - Enforcing escalation SLAs.  \n- Ensure all advisory context (projections, risk deviations, documents) is attached to client records so the new RM can continue seamlessly.\n\nThis integrated approach minimizes operational, compliance, and client‑experience risk during an abrupt RM handover.', 'resp_0b60d6027530799e006942515e2a40819fb7ca0284f3e615d7', NULL, '{"polled":true,"poll_status":"completed","domainResolution":{"domainId":"wealth_management","strategy":"conversation","confidence":1,"matchedKeywords":[]},"jobId":"job_1765953887233_4k0vth05f","status":"completed","responseId":"resp_0b60d6027530799e006942515e2a40819fb7ca0284f3e615d7","reportFormat":"Custom","mode":"deep","answeredAt":"2025-12-19T10:13:19.534Z","isCached":true,"cacheId":101,"cachedSimilarity":0.9999997913837482,"cachedMode":"deep"}', '2025-12-19 10:13:19.692051'),

Governance & audit**\n\n- **Off‑boarding checklist for RM**:\n  - Confirm:\n    - All pending orders identified and reassigned.  \n    - All key client proposals/projections documented in client records.\n\n- **On‑boarding checklist for new RM**:\n  - Review:\n    - List of pending approvals and pending cart orders.  \n    - Deviations and documents outstanding.  \n    - Client notes and projection reports.\n\n- **Audit trail**:\n  - Use system logs to verify:\n    - Who reassigned orders,  \n    - Who overrode deviations,  \n    - Who approved or cancelled pending items during the handover window.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Summary of Deadlocks & Visibility Gaps\n\n**Potential Process Deadlocks**\n\n1. Orders blocked by **unresolved hard stops**.  \n2. **Pending approvals** tied to an inactive RM or unavailable approver.  \n3. **Pending cart orders** with no active owner.  \n4. Orders requiring **mandatory documents** that were never obtained.  \n5. Transactions with **expired OTP/authentication** not retriggered.\n\n**Potential Supervisor Visibility Gaps**\n\n1. Reliance on **RM‑name filters** when RM profile is disabled.  \n2. Lack of consolidated view of:\n   - All **pending approvals**,  \n   - All **pending cart orders**,  \n   - All **deviation‑bearing orders** for the outgoing RM’s clients.  \n3. Missing documentation of **projections/proposals**, leading to advisory discontinuity.\n\n**Core Strategy**\n\n- Use existing system queues (Pending Approval, Pending State, deviation overlays) as **control points**.  \n- Make supervisor responsible for:\n  - Sweeping these queues on RM exit,  \n  - Reassigning and resolving items,  \n  - Enforcing escalation SLAs.  \n- Ensure all advisory context (projections, risk deviations, documents) is attached to client records so the new RM can continue seamlessly.\n\nThis integrated approach minimizes operational, compliance, and client‑experience risk during an abrupt RM handover.', 'resp_0b60d6027530799e006942515e2a40819fb7ca0284f3e615d7', NULL, '{"polled":true,"poll_status":"completed","domainResolution":{"domainId":"wealth_management","strategy":"conversation","confidence":1,"matchedKeywords":[]},"jobId":"job_1765953887233_4k0vth05f","status":"completed","responseId":"resp_0b60d6027530799e006942515e2a40819fb7ca0284f3e615d7","reportFormat":"Custom","mode":"deep","answeredAt":"2025-12-19T10:13:48.501Z","isCached":true,"cacheId":101,"cachedSimilarity":0.9999997913837482,"cachedMode":"deep"}', '2025-12-19 10:13:48.771242');
